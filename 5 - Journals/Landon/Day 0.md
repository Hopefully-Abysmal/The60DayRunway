# Intro

Have until June 30th to vacate my apartment. Have enough funds to get until then and some beyond but they aren't truly my funds. I want to disprove the myth that Gen-z cannot own anything; and help dissolve that "barrier". 

The goal: make ~$500k of money I can own in ~60 days (or at least get my income up to the point where everything pays itself off without further effort if we're talking leverage).
	Items to leverage: 
	Land and House
	Student loans
	Kenya's education
	Freedom (priceless)
