## Was Socrates right to submit to the will of the Athens; to die at their hand?

My belief is that Socrates should not have submitted to Athens’ judgment. Further, I believe a just society cannot demand absolute obedience from its citizens, especially when it violates their individual autonomy and reason; that which it does (if not should) guarantee. A democracy (as Athens was at the time) that requires absolute obedience as the price for its citizenship with no room for resistance is not a democracy at all, rather an oppressive and tyrannical force. Furthermore, a just society must acknowledge that true justice is not blind adherence to law but the pursuit of truth and moral reasoning. 

In _Crito_, Socrates argues that he has an implicit contract with Athens, having benefited from its laws. However, a contract is valid only if both parties uphold it; by condemning him unjustly, Athens proved that its legal system was not acting in the spirit of justice but rather as a mechanism for silencing dissent. As such Socrates owed Athens nothing when it betrayed the very thing he stated his moral obligation to.

My belief is that Socrates should not have submitted to Athens’ judgment. Further, I believe a just society cannot demand absolute obedience from its citizens, especially when it violates their individual autonomy and reason.

A society that demands obedience as the price of citizenship, without room for dissent or just resistance, has failed in its moral obligations. True justice is not blind adherence to law but the pursuit of truth and moral reasoning, and Socrates owed Athens nothing when it betrayed those ideals.

**Key Arguments:**

**1. The Social Contract Should Not Be Absolute:**

In _Crito_, Socrates argues that he has an implicit contract with Athens, having benefited from its laws. However, a contract is valid only if both parties uphold their obligations. Athens failed Socrates by condemning him unjustly, proving that its legal system was not acting in the spirit of justice but rather as a mechanism for silencing dissent. If laws demand submission even in cases of injustice, they are **not legitimate but coercive**.



**2. Obligation Cannot Come from Mere Birth:**

If citizenship indebts individuals to the state merely by birth, it denies them **autonomy and choice**, treating them as subjects rather than free agents. Justice must be **consensual and reciprocal**, not imposed by accident of birth. Socrates’ decision to accept death reinforces a **dangerous precedent** that the individual must always yield to the state, even when the state is corrupt.

  

**3. Dissent is a Moral Duty in an Unjust Society:**

Socrates dedicated his life to questioning authority, urging Athens toward philosophical truth. To submit was to contradict his own mission: he should have resisted, fled, or defied the court to make a greater statement. MLK Junior's _Letter from a Birmingham Jail_ echoes this idea: unjust laws are meant to be **resisted, not obeyed**.

  

**4. Martyrdom Does Not Guarantee Progress:**

Some may argue that Socrates’ death was meaningful, inspiring future generations. However, had he resisted and continued his work, he could have **influenced even more minds** and lived to challenge Athens further. Passive acceptance of injustice is complicity.
