The following are selections from my personal beliefs for reference and transparency. I am of the firm belief that you are your values, and that your beliefs are a reflection of those values. I present these beliefs to the general public not to enforce but to provide a baseline for where my philosophies, ideologies, and therefore implementations of reasoning align with my values. To utilize vulnerability and transparency as my weapon; a democratic pacifist's only true tool -- our voices.  (not that I align with a sole party or label, thats [[The Bipartisan System Was Doomed To Fail|another discussion]])

Note: If the files are not signed by me they are not credible and should be disregarded as such. Furthermore: The dating of the beliefs is there to serve as a record for when I held the beliefs, I will attempt to go through and verify that I hold each belief as I publish them, but long term take them with a grain of salt (if not verified). See the differentiation between Date Created and Last Updated.

The contents herein are not to be pushed on anyone else in any of my endeavors; I believe that to be reductionist of ones individuality and that it removes ones autonomy of belief upon doing so. Additionally it grounds cognitive bias to what ideals I hold, thus contradicting any sort of experimentation or data collected from any user's interactions with any of my endeavors. 

I welcome all to draft discussions (counter and supporting points) surrounding my beliefs as I would love to discuss them in the search for knowledge on each topic of intrigue; however I would like to request all pressure on the topics herein be deferred until the completion of my initial endeavors (time is of the essence and I cannot waste it on my own fulfillment at this time.)
