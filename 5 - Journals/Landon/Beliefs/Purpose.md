I had a thought today after my emotional regulation group ('befriending emotions with raquel contras'):

Purpose flows like time, and is deeply entrenched in its relationship with it (time).
My purpose right now is to feel, to experience, to observe (whilst practicing observation as a technique for mindfullness).
My purpose is whatever I want it to be, and it can change with time.
I don't (can't) have one purpose, because that'd be too easy.
My purpose is whatever I want to do at any given time, so I must serve my actions towards that (unless I don't want to).

Had the intro thought to [[Time as a wave]] whilst experiencing the above.
