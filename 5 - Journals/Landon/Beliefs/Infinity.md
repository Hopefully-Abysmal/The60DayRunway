As we live within the parameters present only on our earth, the assumption of infinity is a requirement for life without a higher power; only after an infinite amount of time (or by sheer luck), do these parameters occur. We are here on earth at this exact moment of time and space based on pure happenstance of the fact that the conditions became suitable for life when and where they did. As such, this leads to the belief in the possibility for extraterrestrial life to occur; if it happened on our planet then why not on others?
