Had the intro thought to the following whilst experiencing that described within [[Purpose]].

Was listening to neo-classical piano music at the time, ebbing and flowing like a wave; I noticed the prevalence of waves in our life, energy (light, sound, heat, the movement of particles etc.) and had the thought that time was akin to a wave as well (or at least it should be). Our life experience as a wave follows suit, akin to Buddhism's concept of reincarnation could this just be the peak (or valley) of an oscillating wave of consciousness? Perhaps one sign of the amplitude of the wave is the human experience and the other something more transcendental (assuming centralized and repeating). 

Perceived as a 4th dimension we are conditioned think of it as linear, but the human experience seems to contradict this, the speed (bit rate; frequency?) of our experience seems to change depending on the substances introduced to our brain (standard neurochemicals related to basic physiological function such as cortisol with stress, melatonin with sleep, etc. or those externally introduced; drugs such as caffeine, sugar, and more illicit substances) speeding up, slowing down, or altering our perception of time and reality as a result. Potentially lending some validity to the theory of [[The Brain as a Receiver of Consciousness rather than its Generator]].
