## How are Mill's Utilitarianism (Competent judges, higher pleasures) and Nozick's Experience Machine applicable in the modern day?

If Mill’s competent judges are meant to safeguard against the tyranny of the majority in assessing higher pleasures, how does Nozick’s Experience Machine challenge the reliability of such assessments? In a society where experiences and reviews could be artificial or manipulated, can a qualitative ranking of pleasures still function, or does it collapse into subjective illusion?

Mill’s utilitarian hierarchy is deeply connected with the potential epistemic problem posed by Nozick—if we cannot trust experiences as authentic, how can we reliably distinguish higher from lower pleasures? It also questions whether democratic mechanisms like real-world ratings could be corrupted in a way that leads to stagnation rather than progress.

A real world application of this could be the concept of algorithmic social media in the modern day; might we be currently collapsing into subjective illusion through those means?

Algorithmic social media creates a curated experience that maximizes engagement rather than genuine well-being, mirroring Nozick’s Experience Machine. By prioritizing content that reinforces existing biases, it can distort our perception of reality, leading to a tyranny of the majority where the most engaging (but not necessarily the most truthful or enriching) ideas dominate.

Mill’s competent judges might struggle in this environment, as the algorithms erode the ability to critically distinguish higher from lower pleasures—what is "popular" becomes equated with what is "good." This could lead to intellectual stagnation, as social validation replaces authentic exploration of qualitative pleasures. Essentially, we risk living in a simulated reality where our pleasures are dictated by engagement metrics rather than deeper fulfillment.
