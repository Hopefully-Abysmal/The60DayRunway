# *** DISCLAIMER: READ THE [[_README (b4 reading beliefs)|README]] ON MY BELIEFS BEFORE PERUSING ***

---

I had a conversation with a good friend of mine last night spanning talks about society, exploitation in business, parenting, and the separation of church and education.

The topic to be covered in this note is the concept of exploitation and how I believe the current system allows if not pressures it.

I am of the firm belief that [[Business Is Essentially A Solved Game|business as we know it is essentially a solved game.]] All one must do is set up systems such that others pull the weight and one can prosper exponentially; systems that can be taught and utilized at will by those in the know. Especially now with the rise of LLM's and the opening of knowledge surrounding business development and economics as a result of the internet; we all can--and are starting to--make our own businesses surrounding any and all ideas we deem novel and worthy. I digress, however, go read the other note.

Under this belief, one structure that is a pillar for this game being (and staying) solved is exploitation; perhaps not as you know it (slavery, indentured servitude, etc.) but on a systemic and societal level against that of the working class.

The phrase "boss makes a dollar while I make a dime, thats why I shit on company time" is a sentiment I hold deep in my heart, engrained through my years of fast food and other grunt work. When the worker has no stake in their endeavors there is no true incentive to innovate, to improve, rather we stagnate--"shitting" on the company time that takes up over half of our waking hours.

The nature of the work and its proposed value do come into play; when too many unskilled laborers are present the value of unskilled labor decreases, thats simple supply and demand. However, I would argue that there is more to an economically focused society than just that. We aim to sustain ourselves and our offspring, but in the conditions presented we honestly cannot do so. 

One might argue that this is by design; that we hold this to incentivize workers to enhance their skills and dig themselves out of the holes we put them in. To do this, however, often requires digging one's hole into a pit, a chasm even; the cost of our higher education system strands our struggling working class in cyclical loops of debt, all under the illusion of choice that we had an alternative provided to keep us under economic control. What are those alternatives though, I ask. Continue working at your dead end job until you can afford to better yourself? Go to a school of lesser stature to factor in affordability (risking the lack of any clear benefit as such due to lack of network, quality of education, even a worthy job at the end)? Apply for scholarships and depend on the communities charity to present you with opportunity in the roulette wheel that that seems to be? Go to the military, some big company, or private financial institutions and have them pay for your education only to be indebted to one's entity of "choice" for the rest of your limited lifetime? To this I implore you to consider, are these really the best choices we can give to our underserved populations? 

The system I critique does work; we have advanced this far as a society and I can applaud that, but we got here at a cost. A cost to our collective mental health, a cost to our quality of life, and a cost to our financial infrastructure (see the amount of debt this country is in ffs). It feels we are keeping ourselves in a survival loop; constantly putting each other down to get ahead, a literal rat race. To counter this being proposed as an ideal solution to progress however, I would argue that innovation does not necessitate suffering! 

COVID proved we don't necessarily need the institutions as we know them, the internet provided a safety net at a scale previously unknown to our society and can act as such going forward if we figure out how best to use it. I believe knowledge should be open for all, rather it already is but we're just in denial of it.

To further explain my reasoning I need to back up to the motivations of innovators and entrepreneurs of the past. The concept of passive income is alluring to all as the key to financial freedom, especially to us entrepreneurs and ideators as we fall in the position of circumstance to actually realize that desire. For those outside of the circumstances required to become entrepreneurs the concept of bonuses and retirement are all that are left. The essentials of passive income but with the caveat of its propensity for the manipulation of the common man; the perfect motivation: to not have to suffer any longer, to be out of the chasm built, to be free from the systems we employ.  I would argue that these incentives are merely a bandage on the gaping wound that is the income inequality between the business owner and the working class; a tool to be utilized as leverage for loyalty of a worker to a brand, something that can be taken away the moment it doesn't serve it's benefactor. I believe that we should all be working towards passive income; that being the creation of self-sustaining structures of progress and innovation is a noble endeavor that needs to be fostered for true progress and [[Harnessing Entropy - A Thermodynamic Framework for World Peace and Energy Abundance|societal acceleration]]. In the scenario provided, the business becomes merely a tool for one's freedom as it should be, not a source of power, not an avenue to control. 

All this to move onto the point I wanted to make with this note: we can support the development of passive income for all, but it starts with allowing the worker to realize the impact of their actions and be aptly compensated for them throughout the course of the impact's life (essentially a re-work of the royalty concept). Plenty of caveats to this could arise, but I have not the foresight to address them all. One that immediately comes to mind is that one must be able to cease their contributions to any endeavor at any time; the work they put in does not lose its value as a result of one doing so, so why should we insight the punishment of one acting out of self preservation? We have already cracked down on non-competes; this is the next logical step in the war against monopoly and stagnation. Through this long term compensation we incentivize meaningful contribution. Via the freedom of vocational choice proposed we incentivize loyalty to one's individual values through the dissolution of the barrier between company culture and our societal culture as a whole. 

These issues aren't just economic, they're social, societal, and cultural. But there is reason for hope; as an engineer I believe every problem has a solution, its just a matter of time and effort. Continue your perusal of this vault, and help where you can. We can make the world a better place. We can build the lives we want to live within our lifetimes. Our only truly finite resource is time.
