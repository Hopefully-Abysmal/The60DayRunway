## ðŸ§  [[_Misc Ideas]]

---

Started day as usual; finishing up my setup shift (rotated desk so I can get closer to monitor and have better posture) see to-do list entry.
	Was looking for music to put on and went down 2hollis rabbithole, love his current stuff but his old stuff is sick af and rich with lore. On one of the [archive channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVQCPwWhUos&list=TLPQMjAwNDIwMjWolFuKry-8yw&index=4) there was a link to an artist called "[extra small](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcPpaItsyOkcLMXImuWvdzUaoK6GJ7P8H)" that I started listening to and within the playlist was a [crypto investing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfHY26ZnYj4&list=PLcPpaItsyOkcLMXImuWvdzUaoK6GJ7P8H&index=3)? very sleeper agent esque; going to backup the transcript though because it seems legit.
		[[Crypto Investing - More by Hangmeas|The transcript in question, feels like the keys to the kingdom of wealth though idk haven't watched it yet]]
		[[Analysis of More by Hangmeas|GPT Analysis]] is actually quite inciteful! A very cool happenstance. I read faster than I listen though so just went over it on my own.
Had some more ideas on names and sub-platforms [[ARX Idea Generation]]
