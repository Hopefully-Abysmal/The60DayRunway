# Notes:

Hope everyone had a good good friday! I saw my energy declining so decided to take a break today (I say as I was off and on awake and asleep this morning from 1 am onwards due to dogs and having ideas that I'll scan in later :/ ) [[2025-04-18 (handwritten notes)]]

Skipped out on meds and caffeine for today so I'll actually sleep; also taking melatonin so hope can finally get some rest; trying not to let the stress get to me.

Really think I have something here; wife and I were ideating on concepts to include on the education pathways; all might not be per the prescribed education system as of late but fuck it.
