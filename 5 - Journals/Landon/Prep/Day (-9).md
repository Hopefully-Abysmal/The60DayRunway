## ðŸ§  [[_Misc Tasks]]

Had a productive conversation with [[Adam Miri]] and then had a Gattaca watch-party. Had another productive conversation with Mason Allen and his roomate Rashan post-movie. We were talking about how to avoid that kind of society; where we want to highlight peoples strengths without necessarily exposing all weaknesses.

Was thinking about ways to use this tech as the new resume; allow one to tailor it to whatever they want and highlight the relevant certifications.
Had an idea for just doing the matchmaking on our end; dating app style. Like between businesses and job-hunters. Allow for trial basis integrated into the education to prep them into industry (short term shadowing and internships already do this but integrating them further into the learning process). Builds an industry minded generation! 

Was late by the time all of that was done (also did final presentation for senior design!! just have showcase friday then am OUT of this bitch to work on this full time.)
Translated more of my chicken-scratch [[2025-04-18 (handwritten notes)]]. still prepping for the ALL-SEEING-EYE that is our LLM overlords lmaoooo
(tryna get GPT to do the heavy lifting in making a huge to-do list // jira integration)

Signed off for the night and now working on this the next day to be completely transparent lmao; forgot to make this entry...
