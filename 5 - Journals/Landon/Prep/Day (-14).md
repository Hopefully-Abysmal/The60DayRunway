Listening to [FORM vol 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hKcoftkv0&t=3122s) SUCH a banger.
	Urge - Paark is literally my thought process rn

# Translation from last night's notes + thoughts now

- Page 1:
	- Dope ass logo idea lmao
- Page 2:
	- Digital Mentor
		- Focus assist (BII), langswap, etc. tools all at disposal
		- Hint AI; lead towards the answer to train; only reveal if in desperation and effort has been put towards learning it
	- babel ideas wiki (zettelkasten template per idea for exploration as a community)
		- Train AI / use AI to make trustable algorithms to go through zettelkastens super efficiently, browsing for data instead of just recalling it
			- Elastic DB type beat? Ask Tim abt it
	- AI Crawling?
		- Spider Agent; inter/intra web-walker
			- browser with integrated shit
			- locally host if desired, monetization through business development. 
			- AI Zettel ERP of sorts for intellectual businesses (IP GROWS using the framework)
	- Notebooks need an upgrade. I FW E-paper but the load times are too long. Hop on the scannable / re-usable trend with heat-ink pens and heat to erase
		- QR type scanning
		- Customizable templates (cornell etc.) MAKE MY OWN
		- Made to order (its just printing the design lmao, cant be that hard)
		- Make them thicker s.t. doesnt indent page
		- Texture s.t. ink stays?
		- Imprint system to transfer to a paper page for storage?
			- Heat + pressure = transfer? blotting issue
- Page 3
	- Tmrw I need to meet with friend for printing split keyboard thing if not fixing my printer
		- do qwerty layout on split keeb for ease of use
			- dont currently have time to figure out how to use it lmao
		- Adjust office once keeb is up
			- rotate s.t. have more leg room for better posture
			- would make good content; people love watching others struggle physically its quite funny :clown:
		- Custom chair arms for board mount; custom chair later on?
			- Sensory isolation workstation for when focus is an imperative
			- also immersive AF for gaming
			- Use AR but physical sensory isolation is key 
	- Neural digital twin for productivity (zettelkasten on steroids using computational neuroscience)
		- Essentially uploading without the bad parts?
		- cybersecurity of this (and our real brain tbh) is a must.
			- Fuck algorithmic social media that shit worms its way in way too efficiently
		- Communicate with yourself
			- humans are social creatures and learn best through conversation
			- "EGO" - Alter ego you tailor to who you want to be
			- "bringing personality to AI agents"
			- "A mirror of the soul"
		- Help differentiate between what we think, know, and believe
			- DBT: emotions are valid, can be resonable, but are rarely justified (in my case)
- Page 4
	- use psychology like that^^^
		- that is how to truly shape someone and be shaped for the better
		- get the people to teach themselves?!?!
		- To truly learn you must believe what is taught is:
			- True
			- Relevant to you
				- Interesting to you
				- Entertaining to an extent
				- Enthralling
				- Fulfilling
			- Relevant to society
			- An imperative to learn
	- I would argue that to learn is both an imperative and an unalienable right.
	- Idea for initial monetization:
		- Freemium model is dope (like are.na)
		- Info and knowledge are free reign for all platforms to use
		- what is differentiating and can be competed on is the tools to accelerate this therefore they can morally be charged for.
			- Attribution of prior work to sources = diversion of funds to that; the only true overhead but it becomes negligible at scale as there is only so much time; only so much learning can occur therefore only so much money can be spent / earned over a finite span of time.
	- Work with any AI of your choosing; integrate into api's to fetch user queries and reflect on them; akin to how social media algorithms track actions.
		- try to predict what the user may be interested in learning next and direct them towards that!
		- use algorithms for knowledge not capital
			- algo for entertainment = lazy generation
			- algo for education = intellectual generation
		- Aim to stimulate X neuropathway; dont cause dopamine crashes like social media lmao.
			- How can this be done safely? 
			- How can this be done to promote organic growth and exploration?
				- Remove the scarcity mindset and replace with the creator (hustle is bleh) mindset
	- A knowledgeable (educated) society is an advanced (advancing) society
- Page 5
	- Make learning fun / whimsical / a journey one _wants_ to pursue; not just something someone HAS to pursue to survive (what it seems to be now; the uneducated are not truly living IMO; need to save em).
		- Education is dope AF and really will help the human race make so much progress if done at the scale and efficiency I believe it can be done.
	- Retort on the scaling concept adam brought up last night:
		- SAAS is MAD easy to scale; just gotta buy some servers and pay for the power -- need education to find solution to energy problem -- especially if people and the network build the product!
			- Thats why reddit, stack overflow, youtube, all these social medias for whatever specific thing are popping off. Stack overflow is an edge case though; sadly the non-coding side is falling off; need AI integration. Might reach out and see if can integrate them.
			- Their value proposition is the community they contain; if that community is free to leave however what then? Competition ensues (for even more progress).
				- For my pursuit, it will be a baseline for a new battle; the battle of wits and ability to catch the general population up to the level of higher education with ease.
				- "micro-learning" is a concept that intrigues me. Bite sized education; facts and shit lmao.
					- Find a way to make that entertaining.
			- Linkedin and linkedin learning are on the right track as well, but they need to make it more of a career accelerative thing than just a network thing; for a collective gain. 
			- Wikipedia with more community engagement would go so hard
				- Can hit them up and ask to fetch their content if they are compensated through the structure!!!
					- Also would help offload traffic if users go off site (thinking money moves lmao)
				- Donated to them a while back; want to keep them afloat as they are my ideal company lmao (they need a tech makeover though; zettelkastens for dayzzz)
			- Hostile takeover of all social media:
				- Post EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE.
				- Discord // matrix // IRC integration in Pine64 dev server as example
				- Integrate with activity-hub; I fw it heavy cause it tells monopolies to fuck off
	- Symptoms of an individualist economy include but are not limited to:
		- Homelessness
		- Debt (without the intent of leveraging it)
		- Crime
		- Gatekeeping information
	- Least priviledged nature? decrease incentives of fame but never gatekeep knowledge? (talk about later on)
- Page 6:
	- AKA let users set visability of content from various scenarios
		- friend vs friend of friend vs stranger (verified identity with relevant credentials to not misuse the information) vs stranger (verified identity without credentials) vs stranger (unverified identity with credentials) vs stranger (unverified without credentials)
		- I dont believe in requiring ID; privacy is KEY to freedom of education. If you let the people learn what they want to learn yes it can cause mayhem; but the internet already has all of that so its inevitable; if people want to cause something they will; therefore dont worry about it and let current security and social pressures work their magic.
	- duplicate finder and merging needs to be automated to an extent; prompt the creator of both topics and request merging // valid reason not to merge
		- option to create parent node to ensure ***strands*** of thought are intact / secure / thick as possible.
		- I like the term strands
