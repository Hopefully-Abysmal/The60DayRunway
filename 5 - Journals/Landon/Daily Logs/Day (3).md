Life lifed today, needed a break so hung out with my friends to let myself recover and prep for the coming grind. Also played Infamous Second Son p much all day; had idea for [[Impact, Guilds, and Community Culture]] and formalizing into [[Impact Compensation Methodologies and Mechanisms]]

Pushing off tasks again (deadline no longer giving endorphins), taking my meds tmrw and locking in (wife wants me to help clean tho so after that).
