# Notes from the day

Bought and am using [[Ithya - Magic Studies]], plan to do a study on its utilization for gamification in general productivity;; feel it would be really cool if one could do something similar tailored to their hyperfixations (i.e. me as a wizard);; feasable at scale with AI image generation and automated editing (i.e. make the character model move by splicing at joints and doing basic character animation? maybe AI processing to fill in the gaps? idk lol but like, personalization is dope...)
