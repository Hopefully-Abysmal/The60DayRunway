**Shit I Need to Do Today:**

## ðŸ•’ Life Schedule

- [x] Make work to-do list  
- [x] Morning routine  
	- [x] Brush teeth  
	- [x] Take meds  
		- [ ] straterra
		- [x] l-methyl folate
		- [x] glucosamine with chondroitin
		- [x] omega 3-6-9 complex
		- [x] mushroom blend
		- [x] veggie superfood blend
	- [ ] Drink something green and holy (Good old matcha my beloved)  
- [ ] Check financial status (e.g., bank, crypto, whatever)
- [x] Eat something (yes, that counts)
- [x] Do a chore (dish/laundry/trash/etc.)
- [x] Handle pet care / errands / groceries  
- [ ] Shower (for the love of all that is sacred)
- [x] Reflect / prep for public speaking / writing
- [x] Go outside (optionally with friends)
- [x] Dinner or evening wind-down
- [x] FORGOT TO DO PHILOSOPHY CHAT ASSIGNMENT
- [x] Need to finish presentation for tomorrow too.
	- [x] Group fumbled, feel bad for letting them down by being pre-occupied with my own life but they kindof let me down so fuck it idgaf anymore (GPT is not the solution to everything fuckass, y'all cant do basic addition?)

## ðŸŒ± Throughout Day

- [ ] Drink entire water bottle (seriously)
- [ ] Move body, stretch, or at least shift positions
- [x] !!BREATHE!!


## ðŸ¤‘Work Schedule

- [ ] BII and Interphrase prototype
	- [x] Extension framework
	- [x] Basic Functionality
	- [ ] Use to apply for meloy innovator's grant ($2k)
- [x] Take and Record myers-briggs aptitude test (need before friday for career counseling)
	- [ ] Reach out to myers-briggs // look into the tech they use for aptitude testing, quite ingenious tbh (culling to misc. tasks)
- [ ] Push [[Consolidated_Notes (2025-04-21)|all ideas]] to gpt to make long-term plan
	- [x] Script to split LONG context into short context with repeated prompt and overlap
		- [x] EX: make a global to-do list in canvas based on the following data; seperate currently actionable ideas from future ideas.
	- [x] made [[Project Planning Automation]]; GPT was meh, need to code from scratch
	- [ ] Decide what to do next (just fuckn code already)
- [ ] Add 'call to artists' to [[Harnessing Entropy - A Thermodynamic Framework for World Peace and Energy Abundance|The ARX Manifesto]]
	- [x] Fix the gaping hole that is space not necessarily being cold (thermal gradient is not self-fulfilling due to lack of matter for transfer) in the sense I thought :clown: // still has potential but likely requires charging particles and shooting into space
		- [x] Ok but like: [Thermodynamic limits for simultaneous energy harvesting from the hot sun and cold outer space](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-0296-x)
		- [x] My ideology was based on heat harvesting and diffusal alone though, which is an incorrect assumption to think it would solve the problem by itself, but a pivot from purely that to a combination with that described within the article still points to a promising utilization of the placement of an orbital ring for ideal thermoelectric conversion. Additionally if we can move computational processing (fuck it even some manufacturing if we get advanced enough, thats the space elevator concept not just the orbital ring concept) up to the ring it lets us utilize the atmosphere as a heat-sink and potentially could decrease the amount of heat emissions within our atmosphere still hitting the two birds one stone justification for its creation. ðŸ¤· Im only a little crazy ðŸ¤¡
		- [x] Though still has the problem of heat transfer without matter damn it. More research required.
		- [x] The key is radiators - https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-institute/sst-soa/thermal-control/
- [ ] Adjust templates
	- [ ] Fix error caused by MGIT misutilization
	- [ ] Remove redundant work schedule stuff from to-do
		- [ ] Code something to copy paste the unchecked from the last days work schedule to auto update the template for next day?
- [ ] If time permits - Fix my fuckn split keeb mounts
- [ ] Finish admin or digital task  
	- [ ] Transfer ideas / organize files  
	- [ ] Filter personal info to upload
- [ ] Post updates or progress  
	- [ ] Push to repo / update site  
	- [ ] Update socials / links
