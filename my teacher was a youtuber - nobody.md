## Misc. Notes
- I really want to be a teacher but can't stand dealing with shitty kids I'm so sorry. 
- Like it really does not have to (and tbh should not necessarily) be such that to be a good teacher for kids one has to be able to corral them. Thats the job of a parent. We need a society where parents parent their kids...
- BRO WHAT NO THATS SO SAD
- Whilst likely exaggerated this sums up the majority of my motivations...
- Too true, hits too close to home.

Comment:
Creators (teachers as a prime example) being able to live off their creations is an imperative. We hope that this can be addressed in the near future with the tech at our disposal -- the world of over-regulated public education is coming to an end (at least in the US) regardless of what we want, so action must be taken. One reference I think is quite relevant is a talk by Veritasium "What Everyone Gets Wrong About AI and Learning – Derek Muller Explains".  We can make change, if not for our generation for the next or the next.

i was recommended a video where

0:01

the woman in the thumbnail

0:02

looked suspiciously similar to

0:04

my high school biology teacher.

0:05

Naturally, I had to click on it.

0:07

When I heard the voice, my  suspicions were confirmed.

0:09

This was definitely Mrs Wilson.

0:11

(Not her real name of course.)

0:13

But the more of the video I watched,

0:15

the more I doubted myself.

0:16

You see, the topic of the video was

0:18

something that I hadn't quite understood in class

0:21

because my teacher had explained it poorly.

0:23

She was like a zombie in class,

0:24

reading directly from a slideshow

0:26

and not bothering to even stand up or

0:28

add her own words in between.

0:30

If kids were passing notes,

0:31

using their phones,

0:32

or just straight up talking loud  enough to drown out her voice,

0:36

she would just give them an empty stare

0:37

before going right back to  reading from the slides.

0:40

It was like she was just going through the motions

0:42

and barely even existed in  the same universe as my class.

0:46

But the woman in that video,

0:47

who looked and sounded exactly like her,

0:50

was filled with passion about her subject.

0:52

She clearly and concisely explained

0:54

exactly what genetic drift was.

0:56

Her 10-minute video helped me understand

0:57

what my teacher couldn't  explain in an entire hour.

1:00

And I wasn't even the only person she helped,

1:02

The video had over a million views,

1:04

and her channel had nearly  half a million subscribers.

1:07

The comments were filled  with people thanking her for

1:08

helping them do their  homework and pass their exams.

1:11

And all of her other videos were about biology,

1:13

presented just as passionately and clearly.

1:15

And she truly looked and sounded

1:17

exactly like a more motivated  version of my teacher.

1:20

Could this really be the same woman

1:22

as the zombie I saw in class?

1:24

The next day, in class,

1:26

I pulled up one of the videos on my phone

1:28

to compare her face in person.

1:30

There were small differences  I didn't pick up on before,

1:33

The bags under her eyes,

1:34

the slight frizz to her hair that  was perfectly combed in the video.

1:38

But it was still definitely her.

1:40

What...

1:41

happened?

1:43

I wanted so badly to ask if  that YouTuber was really her,

1:46

and what happened to all her passion for biology.

1:49

But I didn't even know how to  begin approaching the topic.

1:52

I didn't know how to talk to a teacher

1:54

about anything besides class.

1:56

Heck, I didn't even like talking to my FRIENDS

1:58

about anything besides class.

2:00

So I waited,

2:01

and watched,

2:02

and tried to figure it out on my own.

2:05

First of all,

2:06

the slides she showed us in class

2:07

didn't read like something the passionate  YouTuber I watched would ever say.

2:10

Did someone else make them?

2:12

I did a quote search from some  random text on her slides,

2:15

and found a PDF with the exact  slides she was presenting.

2:19

Looking at the rest of the website,

2:20

I found slides from all of  her previous lessons too,

2:23

and a short description that told me

2:25

all of these slides were included with

2:27

the teacher's edition of my biology textbook.

2:30

So she didn't even make the slides  she was reading from in class.

2:35

I felt so...

2:37

cheated.

2:38

As a student, all of my assignments  had to be fully written by me.

2:42

I could use other resources  for research, of course,

2:44

but never pass off existing work as my own.

2:47

But somehow my teacher got to just

2:49

use some pre-made slides to do her job for her.

2:52

Sure, she never claimed to  be the author of the slides.

2:55

But it still felt so hypocritical.

2:57

And knowing that she was capable of doing

3:00

so

3:01

SO

3:01

much better with her lectures

3:02

just made it worse.

3:04

I would rather have her just  play the videos in class

3:06

than watch her drone on soullessly  with someone else's slideshows.

3:10

I was already disappointed with  how dull my biology classes were,

3:13

but knowing how great it could have been,

3:15

with the very same teacher, no less,

3:18

just made me angry.

3:19

How could she just give up like that?

3:21

How could she just give  all her passion to YouTube,

3:23

and then totally neglect the  students right in front of her?

3:26

How is this fair to ME when I was trying so hard

3:28

to understand the awful slideshows that I now knew

3:31

she could have easily explained better?

3:33

After that, I didn't even pay attention anymore.

3:36

If she was going to be mentally  checked out during class,

3:39

then so was I.

3:40

I would just find a video she  made on the same topic on YouTube,

3:43

and listen to that instead while  she was reading those awful slides.

3:47

Occasionally I caught her looking at me

3:49

with an expression that somehow  seemed more dead and tired than usual.

3:53

I guess she was disappointed that I  wasn't paying attention to her anymore.

3:57

I think I was the only  student in class that actually

3:59

put in effort before I found out  about the plagiarized slides.

4:03

Honestly, the look on her face  made me feel a little guilty.

4:07

But you know what?

4:08

It serves her right for not having any integrity.

4:10

I was here to get an education,

4:12

and her very own YouTube videos were  better for that than her class was.

4:16

Things only got worse when  the next exam rolled around.

4:19

I saw a multiple choice  question that was phrased poorly

4:22

and had two correct answers.

4:23

I read and reread it a few times in  case I was misunderstanding it somehow,

4:27

but I felt confident in my knowledge,

4:29

so I took the test up to the  teacher and asked about it.

4:32

Hey, on this question, I think  both B and C are correct.

4:36

Let me see.

4:38

Huh...

4:39

you're completely right!

4:41

So you WERE paying attention!

4:43

For a moment,

4:43

I could see the woman who  actually cared about biology

4:46

shining through her eyes.

4:47

I... wasn't.

4:49

I was watching YouTube videos instead.

4:53

YOUR YouTube videos, actually.

4:58

...

4:58

Class, there was a poorly phrased question,

5:00

so I'll give everyone a free answer on that one.

5:03

Just choose option B for question 32.

5:06

She handed my exam back to me with an

5:08

unreadable expression on her face.

5:10

I so wished to ask more,

5:11

but time was ticking,

5:12

and I had to finish the rest of the test.

5:15

When I finally got the test back,

5:16

I did a quote search on the questions in the test.

5:18

My teacher's reaction made it seem like

5:20

she hadn't even written the questions.

5:22

And knowing that her slides weren't her own,

5:24

I thought it was pretty likely that

5:25

the test questions came from somewhere else too.

5:28

And lo and behold,

5:29

an entire PDF question bank of exam questions that

5:32

also came with the teacher's  edition of my textbook.

5:35

I saw literally every question  from my exam in that PDF.

5:38

Looking back at earlier chapters,

5:39

I saw questions I recognized  from previous exams too.

5:43

And the whole question bank

5:44

came with an answer key.

5:46

Well.

5:47

That complicated things.

5:48

i was already getting an A in biology.

5:51

It wasn't like I needed to cheat to succeed.

5:53

But now I had the answers to every question

5:55

that could EVER be asked on  ANY exam in my biology class.

5:59

The thing that angered me  most about this situation

6:01

was how much my teacher was cheating.

6:03

I felt cheated out of my education,

6:05

and I wasn't about to cheat  myself out of an education

6:07

by studying an answer key instead  of studying the subject itself.

6:11

No.

6:11

I was determined to confront my teacher

6:13

about all of this stolen material,

6:15

and demand answers.

6:17

After school the next day,

6:18

I found her in her classroom  grading last night's homework.

6:21

Despite my resolve,

6:22

I wasn't sure where to begin.

6:24

All the fiery objections I  rehearsed in my mind evaporated

6:27

when I saw the dead look in her eyes.

6:29

...

6:29

Did you have a question?

6:31

She asked after I stood too long in the doorway.

6:34

I...

6:36

No.

6:36

But I do want to tell you something.

6:39

Yesterday, I searched up the  questions from our last exam.

6:42

I ended up finding the answer key for

6:44

the entire question bank  that goes with our textbook.

6:47

Does anyone else know?

6:50

That...

6:51

You...

6:52

...

6:53

No.

6:54

Unless they found it themselves.

6:56

That's all I said out loud,

6:58

but on the inside,

6:59

I was screaming.

7:00

THAT's the part you care about???

7:02

Getting caught in your mass plagiarism???

7:04

You don't even care if I was cheating!

7:06

You only care that other people don't know that

7:08

YOU've been cheating US out of  an education this whole time!

7:12

I'm sorry.

7:14

What?

7:15

I know you found my YouTube channel,

7:17

and I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

7:20

All I can say is that the school  asked me to stop working on that,

7:24

and not to talk about it to students.

7:27

I wish I could do better for you,

7:28

but I can't right now.

7:31

Please, just don't tell  anyone else about any of it.

7:34

I don't know what I could do

7:36

if I don't have this job anymore.

7:41

...are you okay?

7:44

haha...

7:45

It's been a long time since anyone asked me that.

7:48

But it's not your job to worry about me.

7:50

Just go and be the best student you can, okay?

7:56

It was pretty obvious she wanted  me to just leave at that point.

7:59

But I had even more questions now,

8:02

and all about things she just  asked me not to talk about.

8:06

Aren't you worried I'll cheat?

8:08

A stupid question,

8:09

but I didn't know what else to say.

8:12

You came to tell me about it,  so I didn't think you would.

8:15

Oh.

8:16

I... I guess.

8:18

I was too awkward to figure out  a way to ask what I wanted to

8:21

without upsetting her.

8:22

This conversation was way out of  my comfort zone to begin with,

8:25

and I had no idea how to proceed.

8:28

So, like an idiot, I just said,

8:30

Oh, well I

8:31

I guess that was the main thing  I wanted to tell you about.

8:33

So uh

8:35

I'm going to go catch the bus then.

8:36

Bye!!!

8:38

And the rest of the school year  went just as frustratingly,

8:40

and I didn't get any new answers.

8:42

When I graduated,

8:44

she left a note with my final grade.

8:46

Thank you for caring.

8:48

And I never heard anything else from her again,

8:51

but I was left with the lingering feelings of

8:53

confusion and frustration.

8:55

It wasn't until I was already  starting my first year of college

8:58

that I got even a partial  answer to all my questions,

9:00

which really only brought up more questions.

9:03

It was an obituary

9:05

sent in my school district's newsletter to alumni.

9:08

It is with heavy hearts that we announce

9:10

that we have lost Mr Bradley Wilson,

9:13

our celebrated middle school art teacher,

9:15

following a long battle with cancer,

9:17

and his beloved wife, Mrs Sarah Wilson,

9:20

our dearest high school biology teacher.

9:23

Oh...

9:25

OH.

9:28

So all year,

9:30

she must have been worrying herself  sick over her husband's illness.

9:33

I never knew that was happening,

9:36

but then again the high  school students in my district

9:38

didn't really keep track of what  happened in the middle school.

9:41

And they never specified  what happened to Mrs Wilson,

9:44

but since she seemed physically healthy,

9:46

and she passed on close enough to her husband  to include them in the same obituary...

9:51

Well, in hindsight, it was pretty obvious  that she was incredibly depressed all year.

9:57

all that righteous anger I felt

9:59

about being cheated out of my biology coursework

10:01

seemed petty and meaningless in comparison.

10:04

Was I just being a selfish  child by feeling that way?

10:08

I laid there for a good long while,

10:10

wondering what I should have done differently.

10:13

Even though I wasn't very close to Mrs Wilson,

10:15

I still felt guilty.

10:17

I'd found out more about her secret  life than any other student bothered to,

10:20

and I felt like I should have been  able to figure out everything else too.

10:24

How could I have missed how  obviously depressed she was?

10:26

Should I have checked on her more?

10:28

Should I have said something to someone else,

10:30

even though she told me not to?

10:31

Should I have confronted her  about her YouTube channel earlier?

10:35

...her YouTube channel.

10:38

It was...

10:39

gone.

10:41

Completely wiped.

10:43

The place where I actually learned biology,

10:45

the only place where I actually  saw a smile on her face,

10:48

was completely...

10:50

gone.

10:51

I wasn't sure how I felt about  anything else that happened,

10:54

and a large part of me still  felt justified in being upset

10:57

that she hadn't taught me properly in class.

11:00

But I did feel certain that it was wrong that

11:02

she wasn't allowed to run her YouTube channel for

11:04

the entire time she was my teacher.

11:06

This was something that definitely made her happy,

11:08

and the school took it away from her.

11:10

I wasn't sure if they had anything  to do with wiping her channel,

11:12

but I was sure that stopping  her from working on her passion

11:15

was part of what made her so depressed.

11:17

I still don't know what I could  have done to make things better,

11:19

but I did wish I had told her how  much I appreciated her videos.

11:23

They made me genuinely appreciate biology,

11:25

and more than that,

11:27

showed me how much of a difference  passion could make in teaching.

11:30

It made me rethink what subjects  I actually liked and disliked,

11:32

and whether those feelings were  because of my own preferences,

11:35

or because my teachers were good or bad.

11:37

I wondered if it would have made a difference

11:39

if I told her what an impact her videos had on me

11:42

despite the quality of the actual class.

11:44

And I didn't want to ever have  to wonder that about anyone else.

11:47

From then on,

11:48

if someone made a positive impact in my life -

11:50

even if the experiences weren't  entirely positive with them

11:53

- I tried to let them know about it.

11:54

Not every part of every person will be good.

11:56

But we still take the good for granted,

11:58

and complain about the negatives.

11:59

While people should still be accountable for

12:01

the bad things they've done,

12:02

I think we also have to tell them  about how good the good things were.

12:06

Otherwise, we'll be left in a world where

12:07

everyone only ever gets negative feedback,

12:09

and we lose sight of what we  should be trying to become,

12:12

seeing only a minefield of  things that we shouldn't be.

12:15

Life is too short to not  wholeheartedly appreciate people

12:18

while their lives still intersect with our own.

12:20

So, if there's anyone out there  who has helped you in some way,

12:23

and who you haven't thanked yet,

12:24

I hope you'll take a moment to tell them

12:25

what their actions meant to you.
