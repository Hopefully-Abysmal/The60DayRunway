## Idea
- Reading papers fucking sucks, the amount of jargon makes it incomprehensible
	- However, these papers are the best way to store large amounts of information and credibility into a small text footprint
- [Explainpaper](https://www.explainpaper.com) does a good job of adding ease to this process, but oversimplifies and condenses the information again; I want to still learn everything just need help.
- What we need is an algorithm to parse each section to AI, have it expand each section into bullet points, and be able to query with those bullet points significantly easier. 
- Further than that, build a service that creates personalized courses based on the submitted research papers; brute force re-building the education sector via data science
	- Enhance accessibility to this jargon-gatekept knowledge by essentially translating everything to simple English. 
		- Store a dictionary of what the user reads, and increase the level of jargon subtly to teach the user to read at a higher level on their own
			- Specifically base it on the quantity of times similar / root words have been read s.t. the user builds this polyglottal intuition over time similar to [[Language Swap]]
			- Issue is: 
				- There is no exact count of words in English, but estimates suggest there are around 1 million words, including various forms and loanwords. Major dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary list approximately 470,000 entries, but this does not account for slang and jargon that are also part of the language. - Wikipedia maybe AI summarized?
			- How can I build this s.t. it can store such a large database? Perhaps numerical values (i.e. vectors) that correspond to words and phrases in all languages?
				- Do the vector maps have the same numbers across all language? If not they should, but I don't know how I could program that unless I re-do it from scratch (make my own LLM of sorts)
				- Maybe it doesn't need to be that specific, but like a heatmap of sorts; as you are exposed to more information in a specific area it just adds values to that area, then can do the calculations itself to make whatever changes
					- An LLM that grows with you and guides you
					- "Guide", "GuAIde", "Gu.IDE"
