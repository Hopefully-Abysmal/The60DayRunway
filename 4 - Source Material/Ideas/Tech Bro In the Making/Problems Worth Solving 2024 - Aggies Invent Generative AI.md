* Summarize your problem worth solving. This is your “elevator pitch” describing the problem, who has it, why it’s large and important and why current solutions don’t work.
	
	In this digital age, traditional education systems often struggle to keep pace with the evolving needs of students.
	
	Consequentially, there is a growing demand for educational solutions that are flexible, adaptive, and accessible to learners of **all** ages and backgrounds.
	
	One promising innovation fills this void: generative artificial intelligence based tools such as large language models like ChatGPT.
	
	Though immensely efficient in task automation, this use of AI has the power to do more harm than good in its current state;
	
	users may choose to over-rely on these tools, risking misinformation and unintended plagiarism due to the lack of transparency in AI generations.
	
	Regardless, I am a firm believer that **the technologies acceptance** should be encouraged rather than punished, since the promise these tools bring to the table can far outweigh the risks if properly utilized.
	
	The problem I would like to outline is the need to improve the use of generative AI as a whole;
	
	what can we do to foster the transparency and ethics of these tools for the betterment of mankind?
	
- Describe the people and/or organizations who have this problem. Be as comprehensive as possible as big problems are often encountered by different types of people and organizations.
	
	Beyond education, industries such as finance, healthcare, and research also face challenges related to the lack of transparency in generative AI. Their respective regulatory agencies are rightfully wary due to its black-box operation, and as such its use has been frowned upon if not barred in sensitive tasks involving trade secrets and private data.
	
	The novelty of the technology has provided a new frontier of regulation, most recently exemplified by the problem of copyright in image based generative tools, as the data utilized to train the models was obtained without permission or regard for the owners copyright. The need for transparency extends across all types of generative AI, and the group that figures it out first will potentially reap the benefits of a market takeover.
	
- Describe the total addressable market (TAM) for this problem in dollars. Cite any numbers you use.
	
	The use of ChatGPT alone describes the market for relatively early adopters of the technology in the general population, having an estimated 100 million unique weekly active users in December of 2023 (Open AI, the overarching company, CEO Sam Altman at their first developer conference). According to Forbes and Financial Times, Open AI is earning $167 million per month from ChatGPT alone as of February 2024 (their non-enterprise product).
	
	The technologies power speaks for itself, through its ability to automate countless complex tasks it has the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing by improving productivity, streamlining processes, and enabling innovation. The total addressable market is hard to gauge, however, as the problem at hand inhibits the widespread adoption of the service in more professional settings. Public bans and limitations by influential entities like Apple and Google suggest significant growth upon the technologies improvement and widespread acceptance. With spending on AI-centric systems expected to surpass $300 billion in 2026 (International Data Corporation), the room for growth is certainly not insignificant.
	
- What about this problem makes it important to you?
	
	As an avid learner and tech enthusiast, the use of generative AI has become a constant companion in my workflow along with countless of my piers’. This has given me the opportunity to witness the faults of the current system firsthand through hundreds of hours utilizing the service. My skill-set and desire to develop this emerging technology puts me in a position to join the front lines of this battle, and with opportunities such as this competition I take one step closer to applying my passion to the field. I feel that this technology will determine our futures, it is already displacing undesirable jobs and with rumors of artificial general intelligence has the propensity to significantly change our economy as we know it.
	
- Describe how people try to solve this problem today and why these approaches are inadequate. Be as specific as possible about current solutions and problems with them.
	
	Current approaches include developing platforms for internet interfacing within the LLM, a short-sighted approach that though potentially correct still has the chance to misinform or “hallucinate” data and deliver it to the user as if it is fact. Another attempt is that of explainable AI; groups like Google and IBM are currently developing methods to evaluate the decisions made by machine learning algorithms and report statistics based on that evaluation. This allows for stricter confidence to be placed on each generation as a result but lacks the fundamental solution to the problem: source attribution. Unless a ground-up rebuild of the current systems occurs, there is currently no other way to determine where the model sources its information, especially in automated systems that grow their database and train as users interact with them.
	
- What do you believe the most relevant skills, technologies, tools and other innovations will be in solving this problem?
	
	The most relevant skills to solve this problem include but are not limited to programming, network and database administration, and most of all creativity; the solution will have to be something completely novel to overcome the faults within generations of development. I believe that the internet will be our biggest asset in this pursuit; the main online service and storage companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook are estimated to hold at least 1.2 Exabytes of data (1.2 million terabytes) between them. This vast amount of information on the internet has brought with it the new gold rush. We now have the opportunity to farm and actively utilize this information for the benefit of the common man given the rise of LLM’s and other human interfacing AI tools, but as stated are faced with the problem of maintaining source attribution and transparency. I plan to try my hand at this pursuit and hope that through this pitch I can convince others to assist in my efforts.
