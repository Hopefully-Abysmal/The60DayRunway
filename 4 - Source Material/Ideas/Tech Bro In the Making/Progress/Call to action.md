This past summer I was charged with the task of writing a review paper on Tetrahedral DNA Nanocages; I found I had thousands of reputable sources at my fingertips but the inability to discern what was really needed for future research on the subject. At this time I had been attempting to utilize large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT to try and point the way; a feeble but insightful attempt that led me to the following conclusion: the recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and LLM's should be used to process the seemingly infinite sea of research to foster and accelerate our technological advancement.

As I am only a college student with big dreams and hopes for how I can help humanity, I am new to the world of tech and research. To compensate for this, I am reaching out for advice on the matter with the following call to action:

I would like your discretion on creating a program (LLM / NLP or other) to curate ideal research pathways given a prompt including the researcher's capabilities and resources through a database of all current research publications; I want to accelerate the ability of mankind to research in efficient and powerful directions, taking into account the impact the research would have across fields and therefore its priority.

I have created a GitHub repo to track my own attempts at the matter, but have fallen short with difficulties collecting necessary data and determining courses of action for its processing and scalability. Please let me know your thoughts on the matter and how you may be able to become involved!

GPT Response:

Creating a program to curate ideal research pathways based on a comprehensive database of research publications is a fascinating concept. The idea is to accelerate research efforts by guiding researchers through the most effective directions while considering the cross-disciplinary impact of their work.

To develop such a program, we must consider the following components and steps:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
    - Acquire access to research publication databases (like PubMed, arXiv, Google Scholar, etc.).
    - Extract meta-information such as authors, institutions, keywords, citations, abstracts, and more.
    - Preprocess the data: clean it, handle missing values, and convert the textual data into a structured form.
2. **Interdisciplinary Analysis**:
    - Develop algorithms to analyze cross-references and citations to understand how different fields interconnect.
    - Employ techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract topics and see how they overlap between disciplines.
3. **Prioritization**:
    - Define metrics for "impact". Is it the number of times research is cited? Is it the applicability of research in real-world scenarios or its theoretical significance?
    - Use these metrics to prioritize research topics. Machine Learning can help here, but you'll also need domain expertise to ensure that the algorithm's outputs are sensible.
4. **Pathway Curator**:
    - Design an algorithm that suggests the best research paths based on the priorities.
    - It might not only recommend reading certain papers but might also suggest experiments, datasets, or techniques that can fill gaps in current knowledge.
5. **User Interface**:
    - Ensure that the program is user-friendly. Allow researchers to input their interests, current knowledge, and objectives.
    - Display curated pathways in an intuitive manner, possibly as a flowchart or roadmap, highlighting key papers, methodologies, and potential collaborators.
6. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Researchers using the program should have a way to provide feedback on the pathways suggested, allowing the system to learn and refine its recommendations over time.
7. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
    - To increase adoption, consider integrating the tool with popular research platforms or repositories.
8. **Scalability and Updating**:
    - As research is an ever-evolving field, the database should be updated regularly.
    - Ensure the system can handle large volumes of data and deliver results in real-time or near-real-time.
9. **Ethical Considerations**:
    - Be wary of biases in the data. For instance, high citation counts might not always signify high impact.
    - Ensure that recommendations don't inadvertently narrow the focus of researchers too much, potentially causing them to miss out on valuable peripheral knowledge.

As for using a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4:

- **Pros**:
    - Excellent at understanding and generating human language, making it useful for processing research papers.
    - Can be employed for quick summaries, extracting key concepts, or even answering questions about the research content.
- **Cons**:
    - LLMs don't inherently understand research quality or importance; they would need supplemental algorithms or datasets.
    - Could be computationally expensive to run on a large scale.

**Recommendation**:  
Use a hybrid approach. LLM can be invaluable in data processing, summarizing, and even providing insights on research content. However, for pathway curation, interdisciplinary analysis, and prioritization, you'll likely need a combination of traditional algorithms, domain-specific knowledge, and possibly other machine learning models.  

Lastly, collaboration with academic institutions, research labs, and domain experts will be crucial. They can provide invaluable feedback, access to necessary resources, and ensure the system's recommendations are both impactful and actionable.
