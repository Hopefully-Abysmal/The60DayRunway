## Problem statements: 
We believe future home owners want to be more hands on in the design of their homes but do not have the time or know-how to do so efficiently.

We believe architects want a way to make money from their designs passively.

We believe architects want their customer to be hands on, without having to deal with said customers.




## Ideas
### UI
3d previews of houses direct in browser
	isometric views of each room

### UX
#### build mode
search for house plans based on square footage and / or lot size 
	(if including stuff for yard and backyard, not for MVP but later could be the move)
user toggleable options (parametric house design generation)
	estimated price with each option

export final designs for builder / contractor use
	can be manual at first but build towards automation

#### design mode
start all blank
offer to auto generate layouts based on desired amenities
have user put in ideal dimensions for various amenities and gap space desired
allow user to select 3d models for aesthetic changes (see partnerships for monetization of this)

### Money
#### Partnerships
partner with local builders / contractors to direct users to get their house built  
partner with furniture stores for interior design mode product placements
	affiliate link to products and offer export of shopping list to excel / doc or something along with it being listed in table on site
