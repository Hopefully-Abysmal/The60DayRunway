### Obsidian

To add **Obsidian** to your start menu, use the files you already have in `~/Apps/Obsidian`. Here's how you can proceed:

---

### **Steps to Add Obsidian to the Start Menu**

#### **1. Verify the AppImage**

Ensure the `Obsidian-1.7.4.AppImage` is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Apps/Obsidian/Obsidian-1.7.4.AppImage
```

#### **2. Place the Icon in the Appropriate Directory**

Since you already have `obsidian-icon.png`, move it to a standard icon location:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons
cp ~/Apps/Obsidian/obsidian-icon.png ~/.local/share/icons/
```

#### **3. Create a `.desktop` File**

Create a new `.desktop` entry for Obsidian:

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/obsidian.desktop
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Obsidian
Exec=/home/landondahle/Apps/Obsidian/Obsidian-1.7.4.AppImage
Icon=/home/landondahle/.local/share/icons/obsidian-icon.png
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;Editor;NoteTaking;
Terminal=false
```

#### **4. Refresh the Desktop Environment**

Update the desktop database to recognize the new application:

```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

#### **5. Launch Obsidian from the Start Menu**

Search for "Obsidian" in your start menu. It should now appear with the appropriate icon.

### **Optional Enhancements**

- If you plan to update Obsidian frequently, you can use a more general `Exec` path that doesn't include the version number:
    
    ```ini
    Exec=/home/landondahle/Apps/Obsidian/Obsidian.AppImage
    ```
    
    Rename the file to `Obsidian.AppImage` for simplicity.
    
- If you’d like to clean up the icon directory, consider converting `.ico` to `.png` if needed. Tools like `convert` from the ImageMagick package can help:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install imagemagick
    convert obsidian-icon.ico obsidian-icon.png
    ```
    

---

### **Test the Setup**

If Obsidian doesn’t appear in the menu:

1. Verify the `.desktop` file permissions:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/obsidian.desktop
    ```
    
2. Recheck paths for typos.
