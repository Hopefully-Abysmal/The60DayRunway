Been quite interested with [[Light, Sight, and Perception]] lately, want to make a video out of it.
Did see something cool online though, bud goggles. 
Super cool lighting effects with form fitting to adult faces to use as bud goggles
Prob easiest to do cool shit with AR goggles, but bud goggle kaliedascope programs for AR would be sick af
