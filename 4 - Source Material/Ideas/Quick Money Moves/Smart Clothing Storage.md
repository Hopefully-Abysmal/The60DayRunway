## Drip-safe

Have a UI for outfit selection, store each clothing in box to allow for fit selection and automatic delivery from closet (walk in closets are mid), deliver like an old jukebox with cds or the amazon warehouse

Allow for easy sorting, maybe some RFID card and you just throw each item into the tray one at a time and it auto folds and stores

Or or, use the box with rfid, have the box be one of those folding templates so no transfer is needed, place on outline per box type and fold to insert

Openable like RXsafe for if clothing gets jammed or power goes out, can pull front off (size of door, can slot into pre-existing closets)
