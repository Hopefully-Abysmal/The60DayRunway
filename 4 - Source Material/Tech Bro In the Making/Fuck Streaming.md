Lets get off streaming!!

Starting with Spotify:
- Put all of your liked songs into one playlist and copy the url to said playlist
- Use a [conversion utility](https://www.tunemymusic.com/transfer/spotify-to-file) to get your music in a processable format (text or CSV, I chose CSV)
- Ideally one could purchase all music; ownership is an imperative. Reduce the price of music distribution such that artists can still get compensated fairly but consumers dont need to pay as much.
