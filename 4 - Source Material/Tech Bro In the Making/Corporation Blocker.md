Paths: [[Cracked Ideas]]

""" 
This is where the oligarchic "influence" shows. Ever wonder why Firefox blocks "fixes"? 90% of their funding comes from Google (and the up-the-ladder 'cult' that puppet-strings them). Any search engine which no longer supports FULL REGEX (_,-,,~,AND,OR,NOT, parans) is not a search engine at all; it's a filter, a censoring, a blocking, a de-sovereigning, an obfuscator, a used car sales[wo/]man, a politiCIAn. Apparently, you have no longer got the right to ask questions as you wish, and thus, that prevents you from getting answers that Google missed in deleting, deplatforming, re-routing to WHO/WEF/CIA. That sovereign was already owned, and YOU, are too, as a miniscule corporate entity... a tiny debt payment to the bankers for being allowed to live in fantasyland.

## Current Solutions
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1682-google-hit-hider-by-domain-search-filter-block-sites


## Main Idea
Block every html element with blacklisted words or phrases
	Include text, content_id's, and more if possible (companies will try to find a way around this)
	Can replace with filler content:
		- " *** redacted *** "
		- " *** corporation *** "
		- " *** product placement *** "

On hover can view the content, to prove the model isn't censoring things it shouldn't be (like if it were taken over by a nation state actor)

Potentially look into AI content; score websites based on AI content and put up flags
## Examples
names of brands
names of products

## Repositories to pull from
Adblock filter lists
Stock market public companies
Pinterest ads
Trademark list (allow some though; want to keep small businesses afloat)
	specifically block trademarks from well established companies



## Caveats
Basically just creating a pure RSS feed, look into using that instead of the general internet
