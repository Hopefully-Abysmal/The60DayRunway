Multiple agents working simultaneously under different roles feom different perspectives
	Senior dev, project manager etc.
	Lazy to search for corners to cut, detail oriented to address the corners cut and determine risk profile then implement or reject, documentation rich for human translation, etc. (Simulate circumstances and conflicts of interest to spurr creativity?)
	Commenter / justifier to go through and justify each part of each line of code: looking for inneficincies and allow for documenter to document at lower cost
	Writer to write to each file from plain text ideation (gpt is verbose but can give each file modification as needed)
	Reader to intelligently pick relevant code snippets for the desired modification / lookup
	Output checker to ensure hitting checkpoints on what is to be output by program based on set directives
	Error intepretor for when shit hits the fan, interfaces with reader and whoever sent request to writer to then update objectives to fix errors
User steps in for conflict mitigation and redirection
	Must have human readable log to be able to backstep if needed; perhaps github changelog as framework (make them do commits)
Seperate hardware from user hardware to make sure nothing gets fucked up,
	internet write access restricted such that nothing is released without user consent
	Potentially allow for internet read access in case documentation is needed
	Specific searcher / fine tuner role to bring resources to the agents to fine tune on the fly (integrate with Project Aeon)
