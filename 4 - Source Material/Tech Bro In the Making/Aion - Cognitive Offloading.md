**Proposal: Aion - The Personal AI Infrastructure for a Post-Labor Economy**

**Tagline:** _Your AI, Your Data, Your Growth._

---

## **I. Vision & Mission**

### **Vision**

In a world transitioning toward post-labor economics, individuals must be equipped with tools that enable them to remain autonomous, productive, and intellectually enriched. Aion aims to provide every individual with a locally-hosted, self-fine-tuning AI assistant that evolves with them, enhancing their personal and professional lives without reliance on external cloud-based AI services.

### **Mission**

To develop an accessible, privacy-first AI infrastructure that empowers individuals to train and refine their personal AI models. These AI agents will serve as extensions of their intellect, learning from and growing alongside them, ensuring continued intellectual and economic agency for all.

---

## **II. Core Concept**

Aion is a self-hosted, locally processed AI system designed to function as a lifelong assistant, adapting to an individualâ€™s habits, workflows, and knowledge accumulation. Upon a userâ€™s passing, their AI training data can be contributed to a central repository, preserving and passing down intellectual wealth to future generations.
