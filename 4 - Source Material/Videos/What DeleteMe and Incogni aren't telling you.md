because of where I live if I were nicely to ask General Motors to delete my data regarding what medications I take yes

1:04

that is a real thing they will also refuse for the same reason neither of these companies are considered data

1:10

brokers but what they care more about retaining my data than an actual data broker that doesn't make any sense to me

1:16

is it because they're legally required to comply or do they simply comply out of the goodness of their own hearts in

1:23

this video we're going to find out what a data broker is how they collect your data who they share it with and whether

1:28

companies like Incogn and Delete Me are a scam or not this video is not sponsored by anyone for full

1:33

transparency Delete Me has tried to sponsor this channel in the past but I rejected their offer that said I don't

1:39

know that I would have actually looked into making this video had they not emailed me so you can thank them for that

## Chapter II: What is a data broker?

1:49

a major selling point of services like Incogn and Delete Me is that these creepy data brokers collect your data

1:54

and sell it off to the highest bidder in fact their entire business relies on data brokers existing so let's find out

2:01

what a data broker really is it turns out like with most things it's more complicated than you'd probably expect

2:07

the term data broker itself is a pretty loose expression covering all kinds of different companies i actually suspect

2:14

the reason Incogn and Delete Me use the terminology data brokers is intentional as it's almost too broad to actually

2:20

describe what's really going on there are five major categories of data brokers i'll quickly give you an idea of

2:26

what they are and what they're collecting and then we will dive deeper into each category the most common type

2:31

of data broker that data deletion services work with are people search services these are companies that act

2:37

like modern-day phone books but online much like a physical phone book they're available to pretty much anyone and

2:43

often have a majority of the important information posted for free then there are marketing data brokers these

2:50

companies gather large amounts of information about your online activity and put it into pools of certain behaviors otherwise known as inferred

2:57

data we'll dive into more detail as to what this looks like in a bit if you've

3:02

ever applied for a car loan or gotten a credit card you'll be familiar with the next kind of broker financial

3:07

information data brokers otherwise known as credit reporting bureaus this category is dominated by three

3:13

companies: Experian Equifax and TransUnion they track financial things like payments to your phone bills

3:19

utilities when you pay rent payments to loans when you apply to lines of credit or even when you have your credit

3:24

checked at all in a similar vein there are risk mitigation data brokers these are companies that track your identity

3:30

often for preventing fraud when you apply for a job or even apply for an apartment this is how they do background

3:36

checks they work with risk mitigation data brokers the last on our list is personal health data brokers by far the

3:43

creepiest in my opinion these companies track health related data like when you purchase an over-the-counter medication

3:49

or even your search history of a health rellated topic none of this data is protected under HIPPA so these companies

3:54

go nuts in collecting and selling this data to pharmaceutical companies before we start diving into these categories I

4:00

want to call out the last four on this list are a vast majority of the data brokers that make up the term data

4:07

brokers services like Incogn only scratch the surface when it comes to deleting your

## Chapter III: Personal Health Data Brokers

4:17

data you know what i want to mix it up today we're going to start with a category that just gives me the creeps

4:22

personal health data brokers are in my opinion the worst kind of data broker they collect an obscene amount of highly

4:29

sensitive information with almost no regulations at all to help showcase what I mean I'm going to use the privacy

4:36

visualizer first they collect health data which seems pretty obvious this would be direct health data from

4:42

something like a smartwatch or an app that tracks health metrics but they opt to share that information for some reason we'll explore an example of this

4:49

in a moment usage data depends on the service or tool in question but how you use it can sometimes qualify as health

4:55

data an example of this would be something like a smart toothbrush the usage of these tools can indicate

5:01

certain health patterns hence the category of usage data if you've ever searched for a health related product on

5:06

Amazon guess what they will sell that information to a personal health data broker who will then sell it to

5:12

advertisers and would you believe it we have a category for that it's search history similarly if you've read a few

5:18

health related articles using Google Chrome Google will sell that information as well though Google is sort of a data

5:24

broker and all but name but they're also one of the biggest advertising companies out there so this example is a bit more

5:29

complicated than what we're going to actually look into for this video but browsing history is a category and we

5:35

can count that last we have purchase history if you buy a health related item using PayPal as your purchase method

5:41

PayPal will happily sell that information to a personal health data broker let's look at a more complete

5:46

example of how personal health data brokers might get this information there's a sponsor here on YouTube that

5:52

I've seen a few times before hate sleep if you've never heard of them they make an overpriced smart mattress that tracks

5:57

your sleeping patterns and keeps you cool while you sleep great that all sounds cool how do they fit into this

6:03

picture of personal health data brokers well they clearly state in the privacy policy that they sell usage data to

6:09

advertisers this means that your usage of the mattress and the attached services are sold to companies who can

6:15

use that information to show you health related ads what does that look like well let's say you've been having a hard

6:21

time sleeping for a few nights that data could be sold to a pharmaceutical company that makes sleeping pills and

6:26

then you'll start seeing ads for said sleeping pills or let's say your heart rate is a little elevated while you

6:32

sleep they can now show you ads for heart medication heck that heart rate tracking thing can be used for all kinds

6:38

of weird things like understanding how you interact with other platforms like Facebook if Facebook shows you an

6:44

article while you're laying in bed and they know you've been looking at it for a while they can combine that data with what eight collects and bammy wham they

6:51

now know that you had an elevated heart rate while reading it implying that you were angry they can use that data to

6:58

show you more of those articles since it keeps you on the platform for longer i know it sounds crazy but it's clearly

7:03

spelled out in their privacy policy that they share a lot of this information with Facebook and we all know how

7:09

Facebook is with data remember none of this is regulated and doesn't fall under HIPPA guidelines at all so to them it's

7:16

all fair game also eight charges you a monthly fee to see your health data and cooling and whatever and if you stop

7:23

paying you can't use those features but they still track all that precious data please do not buy one of these they are

7:28

a privacy nightmare let's move on to the next kind of data

## Chapter IV: Risk Mitigation Data Brokers

7:36

broker risk mitigation data brokers are probably one of the most overlooked kinds of data brokers out there they are

7:43

most commonly used in scenarios where your identity needs to be validated for believe it or not mitigating risk like I

7:50

mentioned earlier if you've ever applied for a job or sent in an application for an apartment they often use risk

7:55

mitigation data brokers to make sure you are who you say you are and you don't have a history of doing quote unquote

8:00

unfavorable things with a job application that can be things like changing jobs rapidly or in some

8:07

instances working multiple jobs with an apartment it can contain things like rental history late payments and other

8:13

similar items if we plug this into the privacy visualizer here's what we get first they collect contact info which

8:19

would be things like your name current and previous addresses phone numbers and email addresses this doesn't seem to be

8:25

collected in all cases but identifiers are still pretty common from what I found this comes up when the data is

8:31

aggregated to identify you under one unique identifier rather than your name though this normally does come in

8:37

addition to your name and other contact information but it still counts next is

8:42

location no they aren't tracking where you are all of the time just things like your address and addresses related to

8:47

you like your work address lastly there's financial information this can sometimes contain things that would show

8:53

up on a credit report such as a list of debts payment history and other similar information which leads us perfectly

8:59

into our next data broker

## Chapter V: Financial Information Data Brokers

9:04

type you may recognize this category by another name credit reporting bureaus if

9:10

you live in the United States this is data that you cannot opt out of or have deleted at all this is all of the

9:16

information that makes up your credit score which is captured by the major companies Equifax Experian and

9:21

TransUnion the information they have is used most often when dealing with creditors if you want to get a loan for

9:28

a house or a car that's all tracked if you get a credit card and pay it off every month that information is reported

9:33

to these companies if you get a dozen credit cards and they're all maxed out and you're always late on payments guess what they track that too this data is

9:41

considered highly sensitive as if it gets breached you're at much higher risk of identity

9:48

theft what's that equifax had a data breach a while ago 15 million users you say

9:57

oh and what's that you say they're not only still a wildly successful company they have also wedged themselves so

10:02

deeply into our economic system that you're not allowed to opt out of this data collection despite their very traceable history of mishandling it dang

10:10

that's pretty darn annoying anyways here's what these look like on the visualizer financial information

10:16

contains things like your credit score the debt you're in the creditors you've applied to any late payments and even

10:21

how much money you make purchase history is generally limited to major purchases but that still counts as purchase

10:27

history location once again is mostly just your address they don't really care where you currently are identifiers as

10:34

they have sort of a profile on you that can have an ID associated with it also your social security number is

10:40

technically an identifier contact info including your name address phone number and email address and sensitive info

10:46

including things like your birth date social security number and I mean your credit score is something I'd consider to be pretty sensitive

## Chapter VI: Marketing Data Brokers

10:57

information next up is marketing data brokers this one is fun I promise the

11:02

goal of a marketing data broker is to acquire vast amounts of indirect user data to sell to companies looking to

11:07

advertise their products much of this is done with something called inferred data

11:12

another common misnomer for this is user personas but those are normally made up people that can guide what inferred data

11:19

is actually sought after to help show how this works I'll need 100 volunteers great hi

11:25

everybody as it currently stands I don't know anything about these 100 people so to help me identify them I'll ask a

11:32

simple question that might describe something they do to make it a little more clear I'll highlight the tile

11:37

they're standing on to represent if they do the thing in question let's start off with a pretty specific example of the

11:43

people here who has shopped at Target within the last 6 months great so as you can see here 54 people in this sample

11:50

fall under this description if you imagine the general scale of the amount of people who have shopped at Target

11:55

within the last 6 months you can imagine that the number is far too high to properly identify any one person this

12:02

sort of feels like it identifies you but without actually identifying you it's sort of like a giant game of Guess Who

12:08

but without names let's see what other groups we could apply here so we have our 54 people who

12:14

shopped at Target let's highlight the people who live in Atlanta Georgia okay that's 20 people in our sample what

12:19

about people who drink coffee people who listen to punk rock music people who have a commute between 10 and 15 miles

12:25

to work who here owns a PlayStation anyone here love dogs who here has

12:31

recently watched an educational video on YouTube what about the people who are concerned about privacy these groupings

12:37

by themselves can't identify any one person but if we add it all up with

12:42

people who shop at Target that live in Atlanta Georgia who also drink coffee listen to punk rock have a 5 to 10 mile

12:47

commute owns a PlayStation loves dogs and watched an educational video about privacy on YouTube well that describes

12:53

just one person from this sample but here's the thing i still can't identify who this person is i certainly have

13:00

enough details to know what I could advertise to this person but I don't know their name address or any personally identifiable information i

13:07

can infer a lot about them without actually knowing them these inferences are just aggregated groups of hundreds

13:14

or thousands of people this is the data that is most often used to show you personalized ads let's plug this all

13:20

into the privacy visualizer purchases can describe the items that you buy going back to our list of examples this

13:26

would be people who drink coffee on a PlayStation or even the people who recently shopped at Target location

13:32

information can be used as well from something as broad as the people who live in Atlanta to using location

13:37

services to determine the people who have a commute of 10 to 15 miles usage

13:42

data is information how you use certain services this would include people who recently watched an educational video on

13:48

YouTube or even the people who listened to punk rock music search history can include things that you search for that

13:54

can infer certain things if you search for photos of dogs and puppies often you're probably a person who loves dogs

14:01

if you searched for this video you're probably a person concerned about privacy in fact the people who are most

14:07

concerned about privacy are the people that incognate and delete me are aiming to show their ads to they know through

14:12

inferring what my channel is about that my viewers are likely concerned about privacy and they would be an easy sell

14:18

to you do they know who any of you are no of course not but by watching my

14:23

channel they infer that a number of you do care about this stuff this also contains things like browser history so

14:29

all of the websites you visit can be added to your inferred data here's the big question though if they collect the

14:35

inferred data in the first place and they know they can show you an ad wouldn't they have to be able to

14:40

identify you in some way well they do they normally tie your usage of the internet to something called an

14:46

advertising ID this is a randomized string of numbers that is assigned to your Google account or even your phone

14:51

itself heck even cookies can be sort of an identifier as we explored in my video about cookies it's worth calling out

14:58

that these methods of identifying you are rarely associated to your name or any other personally identifiable

15:04

information it's more of a this particular cell phone has a user that does these things that said there can be

15:11

sensitive information attached to this too depending on what you look at online it can be inferred if you are pregnant

15:17

if you have a disability if you're religious if you're part of a trade union even your own political opinions

15:22

can be inferred what's weird here is that if you tried to request your information be deleted from these data

15:28

brokers well what would they delete i mean if they have personally identifiable information sure some will

15:35

delete that but a majority of the data these companies have is nonidentifiable so they can't exactly

15:42

delete it because they can't trace it back to you the only identifier they get is that random string which can be

15:47

changed or deleted by you if you clear cookies that can remove one of these

15:52

links if you delete or change your advertising ID that also removes one of these links so while these companies

15:58

can't really delete this data you can at least obscure what data you're attached

## Chapter VII: The Risks of Inferred Data

16:07

to okay but on the surface it seems like there's nothing wrong with this inferred data right i mean it can't really easily

16:13

be traced back to you well as always here's where data breaches come in to ruin the fun scammers could easily use

16:20

this inferred data to target people that are more likely to fall for scams with shocking accuracy this data could be

16:26

cross referenced with public data let's look at one of our dudes here this guy goes to coffee shops in the afternoon he

16:32

lives in Seattle Washington he is looking for a new job he has a dog and travels once per year well let's say

16:38

that he also publicly posts to various social media platforms he posts selfies of coffee shops some afternoons to

16:44

Snapchat on LinkedIn it shows that he lives in Seattle and he's seeking a job

16:49

on top of that he shows photos of his dogs and even his once per year travel event on Instagram sure cross

16:56

referencing that data could take a lot of time but this is where spear fishing campaigns could come in scammers could

17:02

just send in a bunch of automated texts and calls to a massive list of phone numbers that were in a data breach

17:08

if the data is attached to any inferred data like companies like Toyota or Facebook would have they could make a

17:14

very targeted kind of attack without knowing who they're hitting the goal isn't to trick everyone the goal is to

17:20

effectively trick just a small group of people since they know what city he lives in and they know that he's looking

17:25

for a job they'll send out texts to all the leaked numbers in that city and they'll say something like "Hi we were

17:31

informed that you were looking for a job with 50% travel we can offer such a position if interested please apply here

17:37

shady link now a majority of people would probably ignore this but someone who is seeking a job who also loves to

17:44

travel well it seems like a dream come true remember the more data that scammers have the easier it is for them

17:50

to target you in a very specific

## Chapter VIII: People Search Services

17:56

way this perfectly leads us into our last data broker category people search services these are simply the evolution

18:03

of physical phone books being migrated to the digital realm if you're too young to remember there were these companies

18:09

that would basically track everyone's name phone number and sometimes even their address and they would print it out in a huge book that they would send

18:15

to everyone in the mail they'd even attach them to these things called phone booths how fun anyways all this

18:22

information was moved online and they obviously put that directly identifiable information like your name phone number

18:28

and address in there the thing about the online world is that you can also have an online presence so some of them

18:34

started tracking things like social media profiles some of these companies took it in a weirder direction by adding

18:40

other public records like arrest records property records and more more specific information is normally behind a payw

18:46

wall but for everything else like your name phone number address and even social media profiles can all be seen

18:52

for free by anyone who's looking sometimes it can be landlords who don't want to pay for those risk mitigation

18:57

data brokers private investigators are probably pretty pleased with these kinds of services actually any weirdo on the

19:04

internet which has been problematic for supporting things like doxing and there was even a reality TV show that used

19:09

these services i think it was Catfish okay so this can be pretty creepy now we need to ask the scary question do people

19:17

search services comply with data deletion requests weirdly enough a vast majority of them do comply and not all

19:23

of them are even required to comply many of these companies are based out of states that are not required to comply

19:29

yet they comply anyways from what I understand they do this to avoid future regulation legal pressure and just bad

19:36

press well that's a good thing you can delete information using the forms on the websites normally linked at the

19:42

bottom in the description I've linked an amazing guide on how to delete your information from a bunch of these

19:48

services for free actually these are the most common types of data brokers that services like Incogn work with so things

19:55

are starting to make more sense in fact let's finally talk about data deletion

## Chapter IX: Data Deletion Services

20:04

services these are companies like we've been talking about incognite me some other examples would be Mosilla Monitor

20:10

Aura Opry OneREP and Atlas Privacy i'm certainly there are more than that but they all work in the same way they offer

20:17

to delete data that's been collected about you for mostly people search data brokers most of them use automated

20:23

systems to make this possible however in the case of Delete Me it doesn't really seem like it's that much faster than

20:29

doing it yourself let's break down one of the sponsored spots for Delete Me just like my VPN video I am not being

20:35

critical of the creator shown in this video i'm being critical of Delete Me and the script they provide to creators

20:41

that's it it's been a little over 6 months since I first told you about Delete Me the simple service that gives

20:47

control of your personal data back to you in that half a year Delete Me has reviewed over 4,000 listings from data

20:54

brokers across the web for me this is sort of misleading in my opinion that 4,000 number really makes it sound like

21:01

it's from 4,000 data brokers or something but it's actually 4,000 individual items so let's say one data

21:08

broker has your name your personal email address your work email address your phone number and your last four

21:14

addresses that's seven listings in this example but just one data broker they

21:19

all do this by the way here I'll use myself as an example before researching this video I used Mozilla Monitor they

21:26

showed that from one data broker there were three email addresses one phone number nine addresses and four family

21:32

members of that information only eight of the items were actually correct pieces of information the others were

21:39

incorrect emails the phone number wasn't one that had ever been mine at any point in history some of the addresses were

21:44

wrong and even the list of family members contained people I have never heard of before all of these data

21:50

deletion services will count this as 17 removals but it was all from a single source half of which wasn't even my data

21:57

do you see how these numbers feel bigger than they really are and it's removed my personal information from almost 80 of

22:04

them let's rewind for a moment back to that screenshot there are 26 data brokers in this list of those there are

22:11

over 4,347 pieces of information and of all of those delete me has removed 38 which

22:18

is very likely from a single data broker given how big that other number is so they're claiming to have spent 9 hours

22:24

contacting one data broker additionally according to the voiceover itself from the first part this was 6 months of

22:31

paying for Delete Me i'll admit though this isn't accounting for search time but think about this i don't know about

22:37

you but I'm fairly confident that I could send more than 26 emails in a 6-month period heck I know that's true i

22:44

regularly send more than that in a standard 8-hour workday what kind of listings well we're talking private

22:50

information like my physical address history my property and court records even the names of my family members now

22:57

scrubbed from nearly 80 data brokers archives without me having to do any work on my own as we discussed that is a

23:05

tiny fraction of the actual amount of data brokers that are out there yes removing this data is good but you can

23:11

do this for free and as shown here probably more efficiently than Delete Me now this all begs the question are these

23:18

data deletion companies legit well for the most part yes i'll admit though I

23:24

don't like that some of them mess around with dark patterns incogn for example forces users to contact support to

23:29

cancel your subscription they also post obviously fake reviews to Reddit but overall they technically do what they

23:36

say they do is it a scam no it is pretty clear to me that they do offer the service of deleting your data from a

23:42

list of data brokers a scam means to take money with malicious intent of offering nothing in return that is

23:49

obviously not the case here a better question would be is it a good deal in my opinion not really no unless you live

23:56

in a state with the right to delete law if you live in one of these states services like this could actually be helpful as they will often look into

24:03

adding other data brokers for you if you ask them to and that could make the process of cleaning up your online presence a bit easier that all said

24:10

though a majority of the people in the United States wouldn't exactly benefit from this kind of service wait I feel

24:16

like we've heard this before look everyone it's friend of the channel Luch hey I just overheard what you've been

24:22

talking about and all of this sounds really similar to what you said about VPN companies they kind of seem like the

24:27

same thing do you mind elaborating well both data deletion services and VPNs

24:32

technically provide the services they claim to and they do it at a very low cost to them but charge a much higher

24:38

price to you the consumer most people also don't really need either service vpns provide a solution to a problem

24:44

most people don't normally face and in the case of data deletion companies all of that information you're trying to

24:50

have deleted will always be replaced unless you're a resident of a right to delete state even if you do live in one

24:55

of these right to delete states you would still have to manually request that your data be deleted by every other

25:01

data broker in the country and that is a timeconsuming task there are over 1,700

25:07

registered data brokers in the US which is much higher than the 200 or so that these companies actually delete data

25:12

from but it's important to note that only a handful of states have laws requiring data brokers to actually be

25:17

registered so in reality that number may be much higher when we take into account the unregistered brokers it's estimated

25:23

that worldwide there are over 5,000 data brokers oh and as it turns out Incogn is

25:29

owned by Surf Shark and Surf Shark is owned by NordVPN so at the end of the day it kind of is just the same thing

25:35

funny how that works fantastic points thanks for the extra insight sure thing man i'll let you get back to it thanks

25:41

for stopping by

## Chapter X: The Real Controversy

25:47

this has me all thinking are we just looking for a new company to hate on hear me out after the honey scandal

25:54

people started giving these services the stinky eye because it felt too good to be true as we just learned it's not as

26:00

wonderful as they make it seem they have good marketing but it's just a simple tool that can only do so much about the

26:05

actual problem these companies are just taking advantage of the fact that data brokers run freely with no restrictions

26:11

it's an infinite money glitch that they're just jumping on before regulations eventually catch up they're

26:16

not the source of the problem nor are they the solution to the problem the actual problem is the data being

26:22

collected in the first place companies like Meta Google and Amazon have been allowed to collect and sell this data

26:27

with almost no oversight in the United States even now 20 states have some sort of consumer privacy law but to this day

26:35

there isn't a single law that prevents a company from collecting unnecessary data in the first place the European Union

26:42

has restrictions against these companies with their GDPR they absolutely prevent companies from collecting certain types

26:48

of data from the start it's hard to imagine that there would be any kind of federal change anytime soon given the

26:53

last three presidents have welcomed big tech with open arms this is not a political jab at either side but instead

26:59

at both both Democrats and Republicans have enabled companies to have this kind of power both Democrats and Republicans

27:06

have failed to protect the people they're supposed to represent i mean even the CEOs of these companies aren't

27:12

protected by their own data collection mark Zuckerberg's personal information has been breached from Facebook data

27:17

breaches in the past

## Chapter XI: What you can do

27:24

okay so what can you do it might feel a little counterintuitive to what I just said but call your local representative

27:30

and demand for better privacy laws even the states that have good privacy laws can be greatly improved be loud be

27:37

annoying you have to pretend like these local representatives have never heard about what you're talking about before

27:43

be loud but be clear in your language be specific for example I don't like that

27:49

companies are allowed to collect data that is solely used for targeted advertising it is oftentimes greatly

27:54

mishandled and results in getting leaked to scammers which costs Americans hundreds of billions of dollars every

28:00

year if you want to learn more about how data breaches lead to scams watch my video about that here when talking to

28:05

your local representative give clear examples identify what companies are doing this and show it in their own

28:11

privacy policies here's an example spotify shares data with these 94 companies by default and I think it's

28:18

unnecessary for a company that streams music to have all of this inferred data data that is retained for any period of

28:24

time is at risk of a data breach which hurts consumers when these 94 companies are also given access to this

28:30

information it stops being a question of if there will be a data breach rather when will one of these 94 companies get

28:37

hit with a data breach in 2024 nearly half of all companies in the United States experienced a data breach using

28:44

that information we can reasonably assume that 47 of these companies will experience a data breach if there were

28:50

regulations in place to prevent Spotify from collecting this information in the first place the risk of a data breach would be greatly reduced as the

28:57

unnecessary user data wouldn't be there to begin with hackers wouldn't have as much incentive to hack Spotify here's

29:03

another example general Motors knows what medications I take and they infer my intelligence through various sources

29:09

of data collection spelled out in their privacy policy this is an inexcusable abuse of power and they do not need to

29:15

know any of that for me to be able to drive my car in the European Union General Motors sells vehicles that work

29:22

exactly like they do here in the United States but laws like the GDPR protect

29:27

their citizens and this kind of data isn't collected at all here's the EU version of the privacy policy for

29:33

General Motors and here's the US version it's clear why they collect as much as they do here there are no regulations to

29:40

protect consumers if you want something more actionable on your end fight back with your wallet if you're able to for

29:46

example stop using Gmail for years now they've read every single email that you get which means that every purchase you

29:52

make is now valuable data that they can sell to advertisers i'll note that this can take a very long time to fully

29:58

transition away though it took me an entire year to move from Gmail to Startmail and even then I faced minor

30:04

inconveniences with services that I forgot to move over it takes time so be patient another thing I'll always

30:10

advocate for is to block all the ads a big point of this data being collected is to sell to advertisers so start

30:17

blocking them from making their money show that we don't want to be tracked like this i've heard other creators

30:23

compare this to piracy but I disagree blocking ads is not piracy i understand

30:28

that it can hurt small creators in the crossfire so if you're able to support your favorite creators directly another

30:34

thing that can help prevent cross referencing your data can be to avoid public-f facing social media at least

30:39

where your name is shown this can range from things like Facebook LinkedIn and even Steam be cautious about where you

30:46

publicly show your name most platforms have a privacy setting that you can use to hide some of this information if you

30:52

want more information on what you can do about feeling powerless to data collection I highly suggest you watch my

30:57

video on that here believe me there is always an option as always thank you for watching
