First past the post is bad because only voting for one candidate
	"Spoiler effect" - votes get stolen;; gore vs bush vs nader situation
	"Duvergers Law"
	We need to do a runoff system instead lmao
YOOO Instant Runoff was next in video lmao
	Rank preferences and goes down list of preferences eliminating the lowest voted thing
	AKA preferential voting
Problem with instant runoff though
	Can win by doing worse

"Social Choice Theory" - Condorcet
	Point system dependent on the number of candidates
	Proposed Head to head candidate tournament style of calculating based on instant runoff
	Llull proposed this system first for religion

Fault: Condorcet's Paradox (edge case where everything is even)

Kennith Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
	Unanimaty
	No Dictators
	Unrestricted Domain
	Transitivity
	Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives

Duncan Black
- Median Voter has most power

Alternatives:
- Approval
- Ranked Approval


# Reflection
## Curiosities
- There is a need for alternative theories
- "Democracy is the worst theory; except for the other one's we've tried" - Butchured paraphrasing of Winston Churchill quote
## Ideas
- Super minute alignment analysis to suggest who would provide policy we (as individuals) best align to
- Can integrate portions of ranked approval; but dissuades personal biases (like who you socially align with most;; for example the republicans and their proposed way of life vs that of the "liberals", both of which target the lives people want to live,, farming vs city life for a brute example to try and prove my point). Further example being the extroversion vs introversion of a candidate; currently favors the loud majority because they can convince more people they're better through confidence (EX: trump, FDR, etc.)
	- The invention of the television allowed for image to be a big proponent of policy, I disagree with that. Policy and reasoning behind that policy should be the only proponents of policy.
	- We can still have spokespeople for our nations; those can be elected via image factors; but policymakers shouldn't HAVE to be the image that one "respects"
		- TLDR we need a more neurodivergent accepting leadership model; this shits fucking annoying.
- Use our aptitude system and that of the social media data collection to determine alignment with policies
	- If not straight up request input on all policies from everyone lmao
		- Further integration could be made by asking people to dictate their opinions on every subject they want to influence and have that be delivered to the people in power; make communication easy to do and easy for the lawmaker to interpret (they dont need to read every message, its too inefficient).
			- At the very least just provide dashboards for the policy-makers on public opinion; let them still make the decisions for this kindof thing but make them come up with justified reasons for breaking away from the public majority (attempting to prevent lobbying from megacorps and monetary gains.)
		- Would require transparency though; run the sentiment analysis to translate to data a computer can use and let the user approve the summary s.t. their votes are pure.
- Also allows for people to have input on policies that they dont have the time to become super vocal about
- Can put factors in to weight voting based on how educated / exposed you are to the topics at hand
	- Was not done prior due to classism (all forms of discrimination tbh); but like we're all addicted to the algorithm regardless of class or demographic and that data can be used to say how much you've interacted with content surrounding the issues at hand.
- Ingrain this into the education system; if one can show all that they have consumed and what they thought about whatever, their alignment can be predicted and refined. 
	- We want to ensure this tech isn't used for manipulation as it currently is though
		- Whether you like it or not; social media algorithms have a hold on what you align with
		- See the alt right pathway
		- See the rise of the trump administration

## Misc. Notes
- Need to think about the above further for DAO integration.

## Questions
- Are there any models like the one I just proposed out there?
