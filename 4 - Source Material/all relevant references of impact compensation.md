Innovator != creator -> make it a creator pump.
	Creation != productization; anything that can make an impact is a worthy creation
		i.e. art, media, writing, lower-level non-automatable labour (all still have an impact and move society forward thus are noble pursuits we should encourage if the student is a good fit for it.)

Impact Tracking (written in increasing significance though I later decided that the weighting of these impacts would have to be set and modifiable by the DAO s.t. distribution of funds works out. My thoughts: Split the time spent by a user by % breakdown of the content's impact makeup, i.e. who worked on it for how much and how much were they impacted by others on the platform)
- Saving to collection 
	- without significant interaction
	- with significant interaction
- Increased relevant content frequency (through vocabulary frequency analysis before and after consumption, increase in relevant topics in user's interactions directly correlates to amount they are impacted by content)
- Direct citation (outside of examination)
	- Within interactions, games, discussions, etc.
		- similar to sharing the content but verifiable;; if impacts other users becomes cyclical, viral and memetic even. 
		- Incentivizes word of mouth / non-algorithmic growth, can feed back into algorithm s.t. the algo becomes more relevant (if the topic is on topic though; don't necessarily want to incentivize shock factor within content)
- Direct citation (inside of examination)
	- During exam pressure is higher, citation is worth more if student can actively recall it under pressure IMO
- Integration into user's own content creation akin to licensing the content and ideas but on a micro-level that works wonders with scale (a penny royalty on something used thousands of times per month is not nothing)
	- Quoting (akin to citing, but directly quoting I mean)
	- Re-mixing (like how youtube does their audio remixing stuff but more broad; including variations of content etc.)
		- First come first serve on ideation; we want all the good ideas to come to fruition and get built on! 
		- Have to figure out how to integrate amount of work put into content on the impact framework;; babel ideas archive would essentially dominate the ideas market by brute forcing all linguistic combinations but does not deserve credit for bringing those ideas into reality.
	- Utilizing solutions provided
		- most akin to licensing, in this case the time should for sure be split amongst creators per video akin to music production royalty system.
All of the above with scale will make each creators individual impact very minute per instance (should comp with same scale as distribution allows for further compensation), but thats what computers are good at calculating;; if needed can floor at X decimal of percent (DAO decision to balance processing power required to make these calculations and tracebacks;; whatever is the limit for un-sustainability should likely be the line ridden)

Depreciation: decreasing accumulation of wealth and influence
- Should naturally decrease over time
	- Age / obsolesence
	- DAO can set limits for how long things can be private IP (convert to public IP and still get compensated if creators are still alive by that time)
- Direct vs. indirect impact should be factored in
	- i.e. integration of content one's direct impact was integrated into = fraction of a fraction
- Factors of acceptance / total integration // societal implementation into the bottom line of understanding should occur upon creator death or sooner.
	- Concept of bottom line hinted at but not explained; in my theory of progress once an innovation is societally accepted it becomes part of the bottom line of innovation; things we cant fall back behind akin to obsolescence
		- Akin to how a company can lose a trademark with societal implementation (i.e. velcro for hook and loop, google for search lmaooo)

Aim is to downregulate the slop
- Accuracy is key, first come first serve is rule of law in organic ideation
	- I.e. if someone just copies somebody elses content but just says it better the OG person gets a cut; perhaps not full rights depending on case by case basis (say if the repeater put a lot of work into it or is a journalist), but at least a cut no?
	- Community notes and moderation will be paramount to this system.
- Factor in time spent
	- Time spent learning, creating, doing
	- the time will already be recorded per content consumed and note taken, just use it again to calculate this
		- Can one track the time it takes to have the ideas if not developing them on platform? (can just promote note-taking and say if its not documented it didnt happen)
	- AI generated content is cool, but should get less compensation due to its nature (lack of effort). Even if its insane quality, should only depend on time and money spent creating the thing (i.e. if you made the AI model ofc you should be compensated for what you created with it,, generative art was a thing way before AI and I think its sick af!! however, the slop just has to go...)


Ideation on compensation calculation:
- Compensation = time spent by users x impact factor (calculated with weights above) x effort factor? x conversion rate to currency of choice
- Utilize time tokens and impact tokens, impact token is the converted token from time with the stated weights and potential effort factor;; idk how one could control the value of the token in this way but we'll figure it out.
	- See [[crypto as backend]] for ideation on how to prevent use as investment and thus decrease volatility


Impact = Aura = Empowerment = Synergy = Symbiote = Antidote = DO2E = ARX


IRL application of impact token outside of digital goods?
- Profit sharing; set royalty based on time spent // percentage of work done developing whatever thing
	- For operators (those who carry out instructions rather than ideate them) sticking to something similar to the bonus and royalty system could still work;
		- If they are x% of the company workforce at that time, they should get ~x% of the profits (not revenue, profits;; one can still set aside cash for research etc.. potentially also just give the workers a choice to re-invest their profit share into the business??? I'm a big consent guy and what a company does with their worker's money should be within the worker's volition. The worker should have the opportunities for financial freedom and risk just like any other business participant!)
	- Quantify the impact of development steps and day to day actions down to the purchasing of parts;; how much immediate value and long term impact do the actions of the operator actually bring the company?
	- each task != same value due to impact
		- roles == value (unless doing different tasks with different impact levels)
		- time == value (unless doing different tasks with different impact levels)


Time Coin:
- Privacy issue:
	- given X amount (average of lifespan) that ticks down and is converted to currency with impact factor
	- Can only do this by stating what was done for evaluation, but that requires proof, a second and likely third party. 
	- This requires transparency to an extent; esp. if using crypto. Perhaps by using [[crypto as backend]] one can keep things anonymous by just having the platform know who goes to who for auditing but not have it be identifiable who the parties are to the general public (just transparent on what we take from the transaction and how it is split.)

Exams / point validation methodologies
- Hint LLM; decrease level of stats locked in upon use but always allow for it to be used (if not encourage it)
	- Don't allow external LLM use during exams, but this shouldn't need to be enforced 
		- enforce via culture and communication that we're testing what they learned and make it easy to re-try and achieve what they need to achieve for various milestones
		- If all the student has to do is consume more content / participate more to actually learn the content and catch up it becomes so much more low-stakes. 
		- Perhaps give incentives for continued trying until success;
			- Could be farmed, but the wasting of time farming this failure would be deleterious enough to disuade the consequences (falling behind peers is a social pressure that can be exploited but not rubbed in their face if they are genuinely struggling)
				- Balance could be pressure of them getting flagged for learning disabilities, and their parents notification; if they fake a learning disability for whatever incentive then that could be a parenting issue not just on our end.
			- Those smart enough to figure out ways to game the system should be rewarded for their exploits and pushed towards cybersecurity lol
				- Reward the impact of their discovery of loopholes via the integration model. (akin to bug-hunting bounties in tech industry across all fields)
	- Aim to train the kids abilities to source information
		- Point questions to request both the application of content and citing sources for whatever information is regurgitated by the kid from short-term memory
			- Can re-test things after some period of time to test long-term memory
				- Figure out how things come together though; ex if someone is learning and applying calculus they are actively recalling basic arithmetic, logic, and algebraic knowledge
		- Also allows for tracking of impact of content (if the kids remember it its more immediately impactful than whatever was forgotten)
			- Potentially implement an impact mechanic that the longer time period between initial consumption and recall the impact is multiplied (if it stuck with them for longer its more impactful!)
		- Promotes culture of citing ones sources on all aspects of life, therefore actively fights mindless misinformation (misinformation's best friend is the lazy researcher)
		- Continues push of education towards content application over just regurgitation
			- I like packback's scoring system but one would need a way to verify the sources the students put on their posts were actually considered when drafting the post itself (I myself have added sources just to fulfill the points...)
				- i.e. viewing / content interaction history
				- Without this are just wasting processing of the links as well so on business side this is an imperative

- **Impact Tracking Engine**: AI detects how knowledge spreads across the network via citations, remixes, applications, and discussion, adjusting compensation in real time.
### Impact Tracking & Attribution Engine

ARX includes a proprietary AI system that tracks the downstream influence of contributions, content remixes, citations, and collaborations. This engine enables the transparent attribution of intellectual labor and pedagogical value, supporting both feedback loops for educators and automated compensation mechanisms via time-tracked tokens. It creates a verifiable lineage of impact, helping to quantify educational influence in both individual and institutional contexts.

Again based on the Semantic Content Tagging and Knowledge Mapping systems, an emergent property arises in the ability to track the user’s utilization of the content consumed. This tracking provides an avenue to compensate the content’s creator(s) over a longer time period based on the concept of Impact Tracking to be discussed. By tracking the downstream influence of contributions, content remixes, citations, and collaborations, one can utilize the data collected to make informed decisions on creator compensation, flipping the incentive structure of views on its head. While not explicitly AI, this algorithmic engine enables the transparent attribution of intellectual labor and pedagogical value, supporting both feedback loops for educators and automated compensation mechanisms via time and impact tracking tokens that can be converted to the creators currency of choice. This system creates a verifiable lineage of impact, helping to quantify educational influence in both individual and institutional contexts; a system that ideally reduces slop and harbors innovative contributions to the platform through the motivating power that is compensation.


Look into blitz scaling

Apparently it is the perfect antithesis to what I want to make.

Example: Spotify

Yapped about my ideal setup; next steps, and the concept of individual ownership of IMPACT, not the companies. Companies as entities can still be utilized, shareholders can be left intact; but the people that make the business happen must be aptly compensated for their long term impact in order to allow them to retire. Afterthoughts:
	We make shit up like social security to compensate for the lack of systems like this
	We pay taxes to pay for those who can no longer work because they couldn't create the passive income we all so crave.
	We all need to put in the time and effort to get to the point of security, but that security must be secure in its attainability!! 
	In this current job market security is not a secure assumption; if you get fired or your reputation gets tanked sucks to suck! Guess you have to live out the rest of your life striving to get what you once had!? Go work a dead end job, lie down and take shit for the rest of your life? I'd argue that that blow can be softened! The stakes do not need to be this high!?!?
	By tracing and extending the compensation along that of the lifetime of one's impact; it prioritizes impact over just paying the bills at that moment. The paycheck to paycheck mentality is fixed at the systemic level.

we can support the development of passive income for all, but it starts with allowing the worker to realize the impact of their actions and be aptly compensated throughout the course of that impact's life (essentially a re-work and implementation of the royalty concept at scale). Plenty of caveats to this could arise, but I have not the foresight to address them all. One that immediately comes to mind is that one must be able to cease their contributions to any endeavor at any time; the work they put in does not lose its value as a result of one doing so, so why should we insight the punishment of one acting out of self preservation? We have already cracked down on non-competes; this is the next logical step in the war against monopoly and stagnation. Through this long term compensation we incentivize meaningful contribution. Via the freedom of vocational choice proposed we incentivize loyalty to one's individual values through the dissolution of the barrier between company culture and our societal culture as a whole. These issues aren't just economic, they're social, societal, and cultural. But there is reason for hope; as an engineer I believe every problem has a solution, its just a matter of time and effort. I implore you to continue your perusal of this proposal, and help where you can. We can make the world a better place. We can build the lives we want to live within our lifetimes. Our only truly finite resource is time. I plan to apply this structure within my own endeavors as a living example of what our free market could be; starting with my own experiences and desires: to reform education and content creation. 

### The Creator-Educator Gap

Despite the rise of the creator economy, educators and knowledge workers are often excluded from its benefits. Platforms like YouTube and TikTok reward entertainment more than education, and most edtech tools lack compensation models for contributors. SCOOL addresses this by enabling fair attribution and royalty-based rewards tied directly to impact and engagement, bridging the gap between teaching and creator monetization.

The cost structure includes cloud infrastructure, AI model training and algorithm deployment, creator compensation, and DAO infrastructure maintenance. We anticipate moderate fixed costs in early development, followed by scalable variable costs tied to user growth and platform activity. Compensation models will be algorithmically optimized based on impact and inter-community comparisons as a percentage distribution of the available funds to remain sustainable as engagement grows. Based on current projections, we expect SCOOL to achieve a healthy cash flow after platform stabilization, driven by the low marginal cost of digital content and high retention among mission-aligned users. (This is defined as the ability to support average to high impact creators with livable incomes based on their content.)

I would like your discretion on creating a program (LLM / NLP or other) to curate ideal research pathways given a prompt including the researcher's capabilities and resources through a database of all current research publications; I want to accelerate the ability of mankind to research in efficient and powerful directions, taking into account the impact the research would have across fields and therefore its priority.

Akin to DOI, ContentID, SSID, and the basic URL, everything and everyone needs to be given an identifier for traceability of impact attribution and compensation (idea for platform: [[ARX CDN]]). To transition to the [[ crypto as backend]] idea make wallets for each entity (be it a research paper, audio, video, image, NFT, whatever the fuck kind of digital good you want to apply this to) and identify the person(s) in charge of the project to task with distributing the funds (to be decided retroactively by those identified as project leads; will be communicating with the individual workers and unions surrounding the worker though such that exploitation does not continue; make sure they know their rights and leverage). Default to even split if nothing is taken within X amount of time. (Yes if they never pull these funds itll be a waste of time and energy but thats the beauty of crypto, if they dont convert the funds to their native currency the value of the cryptocurrency does not depreciate, although is held up; if they do pull the funds the funds go back to the platform / another user of the platform and there are three economic outcomes for that worker: they spend it on the platform, spend it off the platform, or save it TO SPEND LATER. In this day and age consumption is a safe bet lmao, just a matter of time. Regardless the economy is stimulated, the platform grows, and the mission is achieved.)

DAO: Only take on as many as are needed; limit of supply increases demand. (attempt to get livable wages for those with set minimum impact), DAO: Set Price, default to average utilization time and factor in creator wages (attempt to get livable wages for those with set minimum impact), DAO: Keep to a minimum; push for community to cover these to get costs down. PLATFORM IS NEVER FOR PROFIT , DAO: Baseline of funds dispersion based on average impact creating at livable wage, , DAO: Excess funds to be factored in and utilized to stabilize unsteady funding based on predictive analysis

PKM Centric Education - students build their personal knowledge management system up from day 0, growing with them as they themselves grow (akin to a digital twin but of ones mind and knowledge development process and vault. Alter EGO's / AE's)
	- Track ALL content consumed 
		- Stats increase by consumption; each piece of content has benefits and potentially downsides (if misinformed) to its consumption. 
			- Basic model of this can be through conceptual mapping; a curriculum / merit badge / learning category can require a student to gain exposure to a set span of topics over the course of their learning and be able to retrieve and act on those concepts
		- Grayed out stats for purely consumed, student can lock in / finalize the points by proving they were internalized (via examination of some sort, will change based on subject as discussed later.)
	- Grow PKM in background via inter-tag linking of the metadata of each content piece
		- Seperate content from interpretation (physically, like can have in seperate folder and query from seperate databases whilst allowing them to stay interlinked)
			- i.e. notes/comments, integrations etc.
		- Also separate from interaction data (likely just keep that with the content); 
			- i.e. likes, dislikes, sharing, and more to be described in impact section
		- Automatically tag content's relevance within context of user's vault using semantic AI analysis of the content itself (transcripts and imagery if multimodal) and the above interactions
	- Allow users to save whatever to collections of their choosing or just auto throw into main directory for content
		- alternatively just add manual tags on top of the auto-tagging, fuck the hierarchy of our file systems

- Algorithmic Feed
	- Use interactions to prompt feed; aim to inspire exploration via gamification methods to be explored.
	- Can potentially just use the current algorithms but tailor s.t. it isn't aimed to keeping the user on platform at all costs lmao
		- If the current algos are good and the content is just bad then boom problem solves itself with a bit of reframing;; garbage in = garbage out...
		- If the current companies continue wanting to push slop outperform them on quality of content by making quality restrictions higher
			- This is ok though because if we offer easier tools to make the content then their quality is already going up so win win on both platform and creator
	- For mobile have a dating app / short form content hybrid style swiping; left / right to consume / discard, up and down for content switch and history
		- Undo buttons, interaction layer (comments etc.)
	- 


Emergent properties:
- Tracking allows one to track an idea to its source; if that source is invalidated can notify the affected parties (essentially culling misinformation at its roots)
	- like community notes but be more proactive and reactive; people are affected before they recieve the notes.
	- Let society act as a filter for vulnerable populations (those of old and young age)
		- I.e. don't show unverified content to kids who don't know any better and old people who dont know how to tell whats real or fake anymore!!!!

### 2. Impact and Compensation
- SCOOL may calculate impact scores based on content citation, recall, integration, and influence.
- Compensation (via tokens, royalties, or bonuses) will be **algorithmically assigned** based on impact, effort, and time invested by other users.
- By uploading, you agree to participate in this system. Impact tokens are **not investments** and are solely for community and value recognition.

### 5. Intellectual Property
- If your content is cited, remixed, or built upon, SCOOL will attribute influence using automated metrics and compensate accordingly.
- Public domain content or AI-generated assets may receive **reduced weighting** in impact scores.

### Needs discussion:

- Legal classification of **Impact Tokens** and **Time Tokens**:
    
    - Non-investment?
        
    - Utility token for access + recognition?
        
- How to issue tokens without triggering U.S. securities law
    
- Setting up **token treasury management** (DAO-controlled wallet + conversion strategies)
    

**Next Steps**: Design token issuance mechanism + legal disclaimers.

To realize this _impact token model_, you'd need to build a multi-layered system blending **personal knowledge management**, **learning analytics**, **tokenomics**, and **AI-powered content tracking**. Below is a structured breakdown of how to bring this vision to life:

🔧 Core Infrastructure

### 1. **PKM Operating System**

- **Vault-first architecture**: Every user has a personal vault (Obsidian-like or local+cloud hybrid).
    
- **Content pipeline**: Track all consumed media (articles, videos, interactions), storing metadata and semantic embeddings.
    
- **Separation of concerns**: Split content, interpretation, and interaction logs into linked but independently queryable modules.
    
- **Semantic Tagging**: Use LLMs (via LangChain/Ollama or cloud APIs) to tag and cluster content by topic, relevance, and cognitive domain.
    

> _Goal: Turn users’ growth into a semantic graph of their minds._

## 🎓 Education Framework

### 2. **Curriculum as Progression Tree**

- Each **“discipline”** (e.g., ethics, math) has:
    
    - A **stat** (e.g., Ethics +3)
        
    - A **badge tree** or **questline**
        
    - A **content-consumption quota** (I would like to reframe this to "engagement quotas", or even "attendance quotas")
        
- Stats start grayed out until _proof of learning_ occurs:
    
    - Exams (textual, practical, project-based)
        
    - Long-term memory recall tests
        
    - Real-world applications (e.g., project upload, discussion citations)
        

> _Stat locking = verified comprehension. Long-term recall = amplified impact._

## 🎮 Gamified Exploration Engine

### 3. **Algorithmic Discovery Feed**

- Reinforce curiosity, not addiction:
    
    - Use behavior clustering to **suggest content that grows diverse connections** (e.g., weak ties between disciplines).
        
- Swipable interface on mobile with:
    
    - **Undo, Notes, Comments**
        
    - **“Synthesis” button** to turn content into ideas/projects
        

> _Think TikTok meets Roam Research._

---

## 🧠 Impact Engine & Tokenization

### 4. **Impact Token Flow**

Each content interaction maps to:

- **Time spent**
    
- **Retention & citation**
    
- **Integration in new content**
    
- **Influence on others (memetic spread)**
    

Then, tokens are minted:

```text
TIME → TIME TOKENS → (weighted by IMPACT + EFFORT) → IMPACT TOKENS
```

> _Tokens are not just currency. They are proof of learning and influence._

---

## 📜 Verification & Exams

### 5. **Assessment as Flexible Proof-of-Work**

- **Subject-specific rubrics**:
    
    - Math = problems
        
    - Ethics = dilemmas + justifications
        
    - Science = simulations
        
    - Programming = build + prompt design
        
- AI tutors and hints = lower stat yield but allow access
    
- Re-attempts encouraged; farming discouraged by making failed attempts low-value and time-consuming
    

> _Low-stakes failure. High-stakes memory = real knowledge._

---

## 🤖 Alter EGOs (AE) & Automation

### 6. **AI Agent Ecosystem**

- Users train their Alter EGO (based on vault)
    
- AE = rentable agent, or internal assistant
    
- Optional: Sell AE access or let it act on user’s behalf
    
    - (e.g., respond to forum queries, build projects, suggest improvements)
        

> _Every learner creates not only content, but an AI reflection of their mind._

---

## 🌐 Real-World Integration

### 7. **Hardware & Local Ecosystem**

- **Custom Linux-based OS** with:
    
    - Built-in PKM + tracking
        
    - No bloat, open hardware
        
    - Support for education-only user tracking
        
- Sell kits for **self-hosted nodes**, giving discounts for decentralized support
    

> _Right to repair meets open edtech._

---

## 💸 Compensation Model

### 8. **Royalty-Like Creator Payouts**

- Based on:
    
    - % time spent
        
    - Content’s usage in exams, citations, remixes
        
    - Downstream impact (virality)
        
- Contributors get **fractional payout shares**
    
    - First-touch gets most credit
        
    - Derivatives get partial shares
        
    - Obsolescence and decay factored in over time
        

> _The Web3 of education. Except useful._

## 🧪 Next Steps: MVP Proposal

|Milestone|What to Build|Tools|
|---|---|---|
|**Vault + Tracker v0.1**|Local PKM + time tracking + semantic tagging|Electron + SQLite + LLM API|
|**Impact Engine v0.1**|Convert time into stats + basic exam interface|Python backend + React frontend|

Would you like a diagram of the architecture or a phased implementation roadmap next?

## Me:

I would like to reframe the consumption quotas to "engagement quotas", or even "attendance quotas".

### Impact Tokens and Time Tokens

Tokens would track:

- Time spent learning or building
    
- Impact on others (e.g., citations, shares, remixes)
    
- Long-term memory retention (greater rewards for long-lasting knowledge)
    

These tokens could:

- Convert into compensation
    
- Unlock opportunities or scholarships
    
- Fuel DAO-governed funding pools for education, tools, and creators
    

 The platform from my mind to paper (screen):
Activity-pub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform
Blockchain smart contracts - traceable, transparent, and soon to be accepted method of attributing impact to creators and rightfully compensating them.
	Solves AI content training problem too so added bonus lmao
	I propose as a peace offering to the current platforms that we offer this open source; allow them to use it, may the best platform and community win the user's time!
Algorithms based on SEO and the social media doomscrolling machine
	We want education to be addicting! To be entertaining!
	We all WANT to help the human race, we as humans just crave the drug that is dopamine and have found it in short form content.
		So lets give the people what they want, short form content if they so choose but modular content served with PURPOSE.
Proprietary aptitude model / algorithm
	Think DND stats; we all want strength 20 (100 if talking bloodborne / fromsoft shit)
	Apply that model across all disciplines; let the user rack up points for each discipline as they interact with the platform (consumption, creation, documentation, interpersonal interaction, etc.) and get certified at various milestones along mastery pathways
		Current education system does this but super inefficiently
		Those who want to pivot should be able to; otherwise they wont find their fit in society and will not be fulfilled by their work (my goal is to enable this fulfillment)
	Keep a log of this all and build business end to allow one to utilize everything they have consumed as their resume; I am a firm believer in the mindset that we are what we consume,, akin to the mindset of you are who you surround yourself with but in the age of the internet we are surrounded on all fronts so dont really get to choose what influences you.
Focus centered interface
	Lockdown browser type shit // like logging into a VM
	Find ways to ultra-refine the content people consume for their betterment; with full consent however.
	The concept of user-defined censorship is my prerogative; think reddit / discord spoilers, you can always interact with irrelevant content but only if you choose to do so (as it is a distraction one could potentially negatively reinforce this but I dont really like that)

(pulled from personal vault as is now relevant)
- Egalitarian perspective on capitalism; everyone's life is worth the same, the only truly finite resource in the modern day is time.

- Ideally have all tangible needs for survival met; increase bar as time passes as that is the goal of innovation. Should only have to spend time/value on wants.
	- Jose brought up point of intangible needs (love etc.) that can be met, but some cannot be met by external influence; fulfillment etc.
	- Jose also brought up point that a lot of needs intertwine with wants; baseline should just be as stated 'survival needs' (i.e. housing, food, electricity) such that all have every opportunity to reach fulfillment.

- Value of time?
	- Percentage of one's life should be devoted to service of community; to be set based on average lifespan and need within community. Spending time doing virtuous acts accrues value.
	- Perhaps start at baseline of value, can continue spending time as one pleases until need to accrue more occurs?
		- Penalty upon bankruptcy of time? 
			- Death seems classist, right for every human to live their entire life unless heinous acts have occurred
			- Forced servitude?
			- Revokement/repossession of wants accrued to make up for time?
	- Actions can increase or decrease value of time; destruction (crime, immorality, waste, selfish acts) decreases, creation (service, doing undesirable tasks, improving life through innovation) increases.
		- Decentralized control of impact of actions on value; self governance >>>

- Pass down time from generation to generation; how young did they pass compared to the average lifespan of the time? Left over life spills over (excluding suicide for obvious reasons, taking ones own life is the ultimate destruction and an innately selfish act).
	- Advantage of placement on timeline is very prevalent in realistic capitalism; those who came to life before others have so much power over those who came later.
		- Hence needs being met.
		- Focus on opportunity as a right in and of itself (as is the American dream)
		

- Spend time to not do 'chores' that being the tasks assigned to you by the community.
	- Spread the suffering of jobs nobody wants to all; why have people devote their lives to things they hate?? Many hands make light work, in order to opt out of this must cover the value lost by your efforts not being present.
	- Base on region? Gives hunger games, but allow for freedom to move between regions with chores to dissuade the clashing of sectors.
