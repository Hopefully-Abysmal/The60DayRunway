What is a portfolio, if not an introduction to a community, a space, something needing governance itself? For me, this portfolio serves as a personal home-base—a reflection of my journey thus far. My portfolio serves as a space where I can showcase my journey, skills, and ambitions. While it may not yet feature governance-related work specific to this fellowship, it demonstrates my foundational technical skills and problem-solving abilities, which I believe are crucial for excelling in projects like this. My most technical experience to date is still under NDA, and as such I may appear behind the curve but hope to prove otherwise. As a recent graduate stepping into the tech field I have yet to create a concrete foothold in the industry, often required by recruitment for technical opportunities. However, I am eager to prove my passion and commitment through future projects and collaborations. In the upcoming section on project vision, I will outline how I plan to channel my enthusiasm and adaptability to rapidly build the expertise necessary to contribute effectively in governance-related areas.

These insights are essential when building effective governance frameworks for online communities, which I aim to explore further in this fellowship.

While my experience with governance itself is still developing, I have a deep curiosity and drive to understand how systems can be structured to foster collaboration, transparency, and growth. Acquired through hands-on projects and academic endeavors, my technical skills provide a strong foundation to contribute to the design and development of digital solutions that support effective governance. I am particularly drawn to the evolving field of digital communities and online governance, and I am eager to apply my problem-solving skills in this new context.

I’m confident that my background equips me with the adaptability and analytical thinking necessary to thrive in this new domain. The intersection of policy, technology, and human interaction is where I see the future of innovation and I am eager to make a meaningful impact.

## Online Governance Experience (~200-400 words)

Share a specific experience where collective decision-making in an online space impacted you or your community.

Try 1: I have yet to have many experiences with collective decision-making as a governance framework for online spaces, however, have had plenty of experiences where I wished a space was. Throughout my adolescence I was a devout user of the more popular general audience focused social media platforms (pinterest and instagram for specifics).  This prolific use put me in a position to witness firsthand the decline of user experience due to the unchecked centralization of power. The enchantment of these platforms quickly turned into frustration, especially with the rise of aggressive advertising tactics and the prioritization of monetization over user interests. Pinterest’s "en-shittification," as it’s been called, serves as a stark reminder of how a lack of collective decision-making can lead to a loss of the community-oriented feel that these platforms once had. As these companies grew, their centralized control stripped away transparency and autonomy, leaving users with little say in how the platforms were evolving. Instagram’s algorithmic changes, for instance, prioritize paid content over organic user engagement, leading to a diluted and less meaningful experience for creators and consumers alike.

This erosion of genuine, user-driven experiences has ignited a desire in me to contribute to online spaces that embrace collective decision-making and empower communities. I am eager to join and help build platforms where governance is not solely in the hands of a few central entities, but where users can actively participate in shaping their digital environments. In a world where the need for decentralized, inclusive spaces is becoming ever clearer, I am committed to being part of the shift toward platforms that prioritize people over profits and that allow for organic, transparent, and community-driven decision-making.


Try 2:

In my time exploring both academic and personal projects, I’ve witnessed how governance—or the lack thereof—shapes online spaces. A standout example occurred while contributing to discussions in an open-source project, Paperless-ngx, where I observed how collective decision-making could guide a project's direction. The community maintained a GitHub repository where users proposed changes and enhancements to the document management system, often as they used it themselves. Decisions were made not by a central authority but through transparent discourse among contributors, fostering an environment where the best ideas could rise to the top, regardless of who proposed them.  
  
One particular instance involved a debate about integrating AI-driven document parsing. Some contributors were concerned about complexity and performance impacts, while others highlighted the feature’s transformative potential. The resolution came through collective governance—pull requests were reviewed by peers, users shared benchmarks and test cases, and a consensus emerged to implement the feature in a modular way (still in progress). This experience showed me how shared ownership over decisions can create better outcomes, balancing innovation with practicality.  
  
This collaborative dynamic inspired me to think more deeply about how online governance frameworks could apply to other areas, including regulatory compliance work I’ve explored and even personal productivity tools I’m developing. These experiences reinforced the idea that online communities thrive when decision-making is inclusive, structured, and transparent. As platforms evolve, the challenge is ensuring user voices are not only heard but also integrated into sustainable governance practices. My experiences have instilled a commitment to fostering these principles wherever I contribute, particularly in designing spaces where decisions reflect the diverse needs of their users.
