### 🧠 **Bliss in Ignorance** (`bliss-in-ignorance/README.md`)

```md
# Bliss in Ignorance 🧘‍♂️🌐

*A tool for intentional content filtering, designed to help users shape their own web experience.*

- Create peaceful, focused browsing environments on their terms

## Features

- 🧩 User-defined keyword filters
- 🔘 Toggleable “Bliss Mode”
- 📜 Content-preserving replacements (optionally hide, swap, or dim)
- 🔐 No data leaves your machine

## Stack

- JavaScript (Browser Extension API)
- Local Storage for filter persistence
- Firefox-first, Chrome coming soon

## Vision

This is part of a bigger exploration in mental autonomy. Built during the **60 Day Runway** challenge to reclaim peace of mind, attention, and agency.

## Contribute / Support

- [x] Public alpha coming soon
- 💬 Feedback welcome via Issues or [hopefullyabysmal.dev](https://hopefullyabysmal.dev)

### 📚 **Babel Ideas Archive** (`babel-archive/README.md`)

```md
# Babel Ideas Archive 📚🧬

*A searchable archive of unfinished, unfiltered, and unclaimed ideas.*

## What Is This?

The **Babel Archive** is where orphaned concepts go to rest, get discovered, and be reborn. It’s a repository for:
- 🚧 Half-built ideas
- 🌱 Thought seeds
- 🔀 Cross-disciplinary mashups
- 🤝 Open-source collaborations

## Why?

Creative minds produce far more ideas than they can act on. Rather than let them rot, this archive gives others a chance to remix or reclaim them.

## Built With

- Python + FastAPI
- SQLite for simple local DB
- Markdown parsing + Zettelkasten export
- Coming soon: Web UI + “Claim This Idea” button

## Use It If...

- You have too many ideas and want to share
- You want inspiration or prompts for your own projects
- You believe in open-source thinking

## License

This project is open for contribution, reflection, and resurrection. MIT licensed.

### 🧑‍💻 **Elryan Portfolio (v3)** (`portfolio-v3/README.md`)

```md
# Elryan — Portfolio v3 🌌

*A whimsical portal into my work, philosophy, and projects.*

### 🧪 **School of X** (`school-of-x/README.md`)

```md
# School of X 🎓✨

*A modular open-school for learning absolutely anything — one Zettel at a time.*

## Philosophy

The **School of X** is a forever-incomplete experiment. Every lesson is:
- Rooted in personal learning
- Organized as a Zettel (atomic, linked note)
- Taught only once it's been lived

## Built With

- Obsidian for core writing + Zettelkasten management
- Zola or Eleventy for publishing static pages
- Zettels double as blog posts, lessons, and scripts

## Early Topics

- 🧠 Dev Foundations: Setup, habits, and project planning
- 🔐 Web Privacy for Creators
- 💡 “Creating Without Burning Out”

## Structure

Every "course" is a folder of zettels. Some are deep, some are half-baked. Some are jokes. That’s the point.

Would you like me to drop these as `.md` files in the project folder structure too? Or bundle them into an installable starter template on GitHub?

Here’s a `README.md` for **The 60 Day Runway**, tying in the broader philosophical and systemic mission of **The Arx Foundation** — structured, inspiring, and ready for GitHub or your public site:

---

```md
# The 60 Day Runway ✈️  
_The Beginnings of The Arx Foundation_

## What Is This?

**The 60 Day Runway** is a public 2-month challenge to escape student debt, secure housing, and build a sustainable, creator-owned life — all before June 30, 2025. It's a test of self-rescue, autonomy, and creative momentum.

This isn’t just a hustle. It’s the **origin story of The Arx Foundation** — a long-term effort to build tools, ideas, and support structures for people stuck in survival loops. The goal is to challenge the myth of merit, reveal the hidden architecture of economic traps, and share everything I learn in the open.

## Why?

Because I graduated with honors and still can't afford rent.  
Because my wife deserves a degree without our lives collapsing.  
Because I want to build something that helps others do the same.

And because I believe in making it visible — in **livestreaming** the climb, the mistakes, the breakthroughs, and the burnout.

## Core Projects

| **Elryan Portfolio**   | A living dev portfolio and mirror of my evolving identity     |

## Built With

- 🧠 **Obsidian** + Zettelkasten (knowledge work)
- 🛠️ **JavaScript**, **Python**, **TailwindCSS**, **Astro**, **FastAPI**
- 💡 Livestreams, blogs, devlogs, and mini-lessons
- 🎥 Community-supported via [HopefullyAbysmal](https://hopefullyabysmal.dev)

## Immediate Needs

- **Funding support** for editors, moderators, and infrastructure
- **All video revenue** is being shared among collaborators based on time/impact
- Looking for grants, community backers, or people who want to co-build something different

## Long-Term Vision: The Arx Foundation

> "What if the systems we need already exist — they just haven't been connected yet?"

**The Arx Foundation** is the name I’m giving to this larger dream — a network of open tools, ideas, stories, and support systems to help people survive long enough to create. It starts with me, but it won’t end with me.
