(pulled from personal vault as is now relevant)
- Egalitarian perspective on capitalism; everyone's life is worth the same, the only truly finite resource in the modern day is time.

- Ideally have all tangible needs for survival met; increase bar as time passes as that is the goal of innovation. Should only have to spend time/value on wants.
	- Jose brought up point of intangible needs (love etc.) that can be met, but some cannot be met by external influence; fulfillment etc.
	- Jose also brought up point that a lot of needs intertwine with wants; baseline should just be as stated 'survival needs' (i.e. housing, food, electricity) such that all have every opportunity to reach fulfillment.

- Value of time?
	- Percentage of one's life should be devoted to service of community; to be set based on average lifespan and need within community. Spending time doing virtuous acts accrues value.
	- Perhaps start at baseline of value, can continue spending time as one pleases until need to accrue more occurs?
		- Penalty upon bankruptcy of time? 
			- Death seems classist, right for every human to live their entire life unless heinous acts have occurred
			- Forced servitude?
			- Revokement/repossession of wants accrued to make up for time?
	- Actions can increase or decrease value of time; destruction (crime, immorality, waste, selfish acts) decreases, creation (service, doing undesirable tasks, improving life through innovation) increases.
		- Decentralized control of impact of actions on value; self governance >>>

- Pass down time from generation to generation; how young did they pass compared to the average lifespan of the time? Left over life spills over (excluding suicide for obvious reasons, taking ones own life is the ultimate destruction and an innately selfish act).
	- Advantage of placement on timeline is very prevalent in realistic capitalism; those who came to life before others have so much power over those who came later.
		- Hence needs being met.
		- Focus on opportunity as a right in and of itself (as is the American dream)
		

- Spend time to not do 'chores' that being the tasks assigned to you by the community.
	- Spread the suffering of jobs nobody wants to all; why have people devote their lives to things they hate?? Many hands make light work, in order to opt out of this must cover the value lost by your efforts not being present.
	- Base on region? Gives hunger games, but allow for freedom to move between regions with chores to dissuade the clashing of sectors.
		- Then again, all regions have some needs that need to be met; just some may be particular to certain regions; like farming in areas where the weather and soil is just right for specific crops.
