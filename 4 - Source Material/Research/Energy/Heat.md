why cant we just harness the energy in the local environment? like texas is so fuckn hot; convert heat to electricity?

Double-effect; global warming becomes a feature not a flaw; the greenhouse gases are just a tool to increase the amount of radiative energy captured by the planet. We can also expand the habitable region of the planet away from the equator such that land disputes are a non-issue.
