# GTFO Housing

Non profit rental properties

Community owned

Lower than market value

Pay people back what we save for them once done with program such that they can buy a house
	Deposit towards this, but essentially rent is adding to the deposit
	Also have loan programs that are used for community stuff potentially

Transparent about where the money not saved goes

Can elect people to do HOA type shit
	Cohorts?
	Community justice system for violations

Graduation or eviction requirement of time or money gained (enough to get own house)
	To give others opportunities and encourage people to take it seriously
	Still give them what they save though
	3 strike rule for not paying rent; deducted from saved amount (for when life is tough)

Work study to help with cost of housing

Decently thorough applicant screening, but know when to give chances
	Fuck persecution of drug offences / life ruining shit done years ago
