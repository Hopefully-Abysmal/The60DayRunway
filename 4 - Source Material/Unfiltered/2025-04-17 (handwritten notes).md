# Typed notes:

The commencement
- bleh, they think I can't so I'll just have to show them its possible
- Condensing all into the education reform as one package is a good insight however
Ideas:
- The colosseum:
	- Twitch on steroids, intellectual WARS
	- Turn that shit into a game show and people would pay to watch it; sheep love good entertainment.
	- Political Debates
		- Gamify it
		- Ban/penalize ~~gerrymandering~~ filibustering
		- Court of public opinion
		- Require participants to forsake the algorithms they so cling to (no social media campaigns nor marketing teams)
		- Fuck the modern day cheating that occurs to win the people over; need honest and transparent debating of relevant topics.
	- We can all be rock-stars, it just takes effort.
Notes taken during EQ Course
- "check the facts" - algorithmically list all interpretations and facts; figure out how to seperate them and take distributions for most common interpretations of all facts // summations of fact. Verify the facts. Let the people believe what they want to believe yes, but ensure they're based on fact.
- Attribution, Acceptance, Agency (Autonomy), and Accountability are the keys to peace (economic and social peace regarding labor and wages)
	- Denial is the antithesis // key to (further) suffering.
Library Economy may have some weight.
- I am a library kid through and through, I love learning.
	- When we didn't have anything we had the library system. That is the backbone of intellectual stability, and I would go as far as to say the backbone of most if not all positive change.
Time Coin:
- Privacy issue:
	- given X amount (average of lifespan) that ticks down and is converted to currency with impact factor
	- Can only do this by stating what was done for evaluation, but that requires proof, a second and likely third party. 
	- This requires transparency to an extent; esp. if using crypto. Perhaps by using [[crypto as backend]] one can keep things anonymous by just having the platform know who goes to who for auditing but not have it be identifiable who the parties are to the general public (just transparent on what we take from the transaction and how it is split.)
Development milestones:
- For ai comp focus on feed aspect
- Look into: 
	- network of education
	- Educational
	- School Og.
Patent? Keep in my IP portfolio?
- Meh
- Provisional if so though;; getting in contact with a lawyer 4/21
Big-co ideologies:
- "let startups do it"
- "innovation by acquisition"
	AKA they DEPEND on us having cool ideas. That is leverage. THAT is our key to freedom. They have become too slow and are rife with the problem of stagnation. We can outpace them and they know that; so our best key is to resist acquisition by all costs.
Problem Statement: "The current situation is bad because _blank_"
Value Proposition: "We solve this by _blank_"
