# GPT Refinement: [[Realizing the PKM Education Model]]

# Raw Notes:
- PKM Centric Education - students build their personal knowledge management system up from day 0, growing with them as they themselves grow (akin to a digital twin but of ones mind and knowledge development process and vault. Alter EGO's / AE's)
	- Track ALL content consumed 
		- Stats increase by consumption; each piece of content has benefits and potentially downsides (if misinformed) to its consumption. 
			- Basic model of this can be through conceptual mapping; a curriculum / merit badge / learning category can require a student to gain exposure to a set span of topics over the course of their learning and be able to retrieve and act on those concepts
		- Grayed out stats for purely consumed, student can lock in / finalize the points by proving they were internalized (via examination of some sort, will change based on subject as discussed later.)
	- Grow PKM in background via inter-tag linking of the metadata of each content piece
		- Seperate content from interpretation (physically, like can have in seperate folder and query from seperate databases whilst allowing them to stay interlinked)
			- i.e. notes/comments, integrations etc.
		- Also separate from interaction data (likely just keep that with the content); 
			- i.e. likes, dislikes, sharing, and more to be described in impact section
		- Automatically tag content's relevance within context of user's vault using semantic AI analysis of the content itself (transcripts and imagery if multimodal) and the above interactions
	- Allow users to save whatever to collections of their choosing or just auto throw into main directory for content
		- alternatively just add manual tags on top of the auto-tagging, fuck the hierarchy of our file systems

- Algorithmic Feed
	- Use interactions to prompt feed; aim to inspire exploration via gamification methods to be explored.
	- Can potentially just use the current algorithms but tailor s.t. it isn't aimed to keeping the user on platform at all costs lmao
		- If the current algos are good and the content is just bad then boom problem solves itself with a bit of reframing;; garbage in = garbage out...
		- If the current companies continue wanting to push slop outperform them on quality of content by making quality restrictions higher
			- This is ok though because if we offer easier tools to make the content then their quality is already going up so win win on both platform and creator
	- For mobile have a dating app / short form content hybrid style swiping; left / right to consume / discard, up and down for content switch and history
		- Undo buttons, interaction layer (comments etc.)
	- 


Emergent properties:
- Tracking allows one to track an idea to its source; if that source is invalidated can notify the affected parties (essentially culling misinformation at its roots)
	- like community notes but be more proactive and reactive; people are affected before they recieve the notes.
	- Let society act as a filter for vulnerable populations (those of old and young age)
		- I.e. don't show unverified content to kids who don't know any better and old people who dont know how to tell whats real or fake anymore!!!!


Exams / point validation methodologies
- Hint LLM; decrease level of stats locked in upon use but always allow for it to be used (if not encourage it)
	- Don't allow external LLM use during exams, but this shouldn't need to be enforced 
		- enforce via culture and communication that we're testing what they learned and make it easy to re-try and achieve what they need to achieve for various milestones
		- If all the student has to do is consume more content / participate more to actually learn the content and catch up it becomes so much more low-stakes. 
		- Perhaps give incentives for continued trying until success;
			- Could be farmed, but the wasting of time farming this failure would be deleterious enough to disuade the consequences (falling behind peers is a social pressure that can be exploited but not rubbed in their face if they are genuinely struggling)
				- Balance could be pressure of them getting flagged for learning disabilities, and their parents notification; if they fake a learning disability for whatever incentive then that could be a parenting issue not just on our end.
			- Those smart enough to figure out ways to game the system should be rewarded for their exploits and pushed towards cybersecurity lol
				- Reward the impact of their discovery of loopholes via the integration model. (akin to bug-hunting bounties in tech industry across all fields)
	- Aim to train the kids abilities to source information
		- Point questions to request both the application of content and citing sources for whatever information is regurgitated by the kid from short-term memory
			- Can re-test things after some period of time to test long-term memory
				- Figure out how things come together though; ex if someone is learning and applying calculus they are actively recalling basic arithmetic, logic, and algebraic knowledge
		- Also allows for tracking of impact of content (if the kids remember it its more immediately impactful than whatever was forgotten)
			- Potentially implement an impact mechanic that the longer time period between initial consumption and recall the impact is multiplied (if it stuck with them for longer its more impactful!)
		- Promotes culture of citing ones sources on all aspects of life, therefore actively fights mindless misinformation (misinformation's best friend is the lazy researcher)
		- Continues push of education towards content application over just regurgitation
			- I like packback's scoring system but one would need a way to verify the sources the students put on their posts were actually considered when drafting the post itself (I myself have added sources just to fulfill the points...)
				- i.e. viewing / content interaction history
				- Without this are just wasting processing of the links as well so on business side this is an imperative

Emergent properties:
- ability to train AI to cite sources too!
- learn what within content is truly memorable and lean into that with teaching methods
	- per student!!!
	- within overall curriculum

Continued Exams / point validation methodologies:
- Vary by subject:
	- subject application is based on what?
	- History on decision-making theory and the long term impacts of decisions
	- Ethics on framework application and decision-making theory
	- Mathematics on logic and problem solving
	- programming on logic and experience (information recall); in modern day effective prompting and architecting of solutions too so we gotta lean into that
	- writing / language application on linguistics and literature comprehension
	- science / research on experimentation methodologies and data analysis
	- Economics on systems thinking and data analysis
	- Life skills on application itself! Experience and mentorship based evaluation
	- Etc... (tldr questions are just different types per subject as they should be, let subject matter experts decide this as we already do)

Gamification by subject; all applying points to respective discipline categories akin to content consumption
- AR would be sick for
	- history: RPG's
	- Science: experimentation simulation
	- life skills: do IRL things with potential HUD assistance
- Video Games can be nerdy and cool still
	- history: node exploration, choose your own adventure
	- ethics: choose your own adventure (maybe integrate historical moral frameworks)
- General project based "games"
	- writing: language crafting / translation? (deciphering linguistics based on etymology)
	- Economics: mock-investment simulations, systemic architecture application simulations, the systems games steve jobs mentioned in that one talk
	- Engineering: problem solving competitions, robotics competitions, general fabrication speed contests (cad on up; solution to manufactured product speed competitions), some way to compete on prototyping skills?

Impact Tracking (written in increasing significance though I later decided that the weighting of these impacts would have to be set and modifiable by the DAO s.t. distribution of funds works out. My thoughts: Split the time spent by a user by % breakdown of the content's impact makeup, i.e. who worked on it for how much and how much were they impacted by others on the platform)
- Saving to collection 
	- without significant interaction
	- with significant interaction
- Increased relevant content frequency (through vocabulary frequency analysis before and after consumption, increase in relevant topics in user's interactions directly correlates to amount they are impacted by content)
- Direct citation (outside of examination)
	- Within interactions, games, discussions, etc.
		- similar to sharing the content but verifiable;; if impacts other users becomes cyclical, viral and memetic even. 
		- Incentivizes word of mouth / non-algorithmic growth, can feed back into algorithm s.t. the algo becomes more relevant (if the topic is on topic though; don't necessarily want to incentivize shock factor within content)
- Direct citation (inside of examination)
	- During exam pressure is higher, citation is worth more if student can actively recall it under pressure IMO
- Integration into user's own content creation akin to licensing the content and ideas but on a micro-level that works wonders with scale (a penny royalty on something used thousands of times per month is not nothing)
	- Quoting (akin to citing, but directly quoting I mean)
	- Re-mixing (like how youtube does their audio remixing stuff but more broad; including variations of content etc.)
		- First come first serve on ideation; we want all the good ideas to come to fruition and get built on! 
		- Have to figure out how to integrate amount of work put into content on the impact framework;; babel ideas archive would essentially dominate the ideas market by brute forcing all linguistic combinations but does not deserve credit for bringing those ideas into reality.
	- Utilizing solutions provided
		- most akin to licensing, in this case the time should for sure be split amongst creators per video akin to music production royalty system.
All of the above with scale will make each creators individual impact very minute per instance (should comp with same scale as distribution allows for further compensation), but thats what computers are good at calculating;; if needed can floor at X decimal of percent (DAO decision to balance processing power required to make these calculations and tracebacks;; whatever is the limit for un-sustainability should likely be the line ridden)

Depreciation: decreasing accumulation of wealth and influence
- Should naturally decrease over time
	- Age / obsolesence
	- DAO can set limits for how long things can be private IP (convert to public IP and still get compensated if creators are still alive by that time)
- Direct vs. indirect impact should be factored in
	- i.e. integration of content one's direct impact was integrated into = fraction of a fraction
- Factors of acceptance / total integration // societal implementation into the bottom line of understanding should occur upon creator death or sooner.
	- Concept of bottom line hinted at but not explained; in my theory of progress once an innovation is societally accepted it becomes part of the bottom line of innovation; things we cant fall back behind akin to obsolescence
		- Akin to how a company can lose a trademark with societal implementation (i.e. velcro for hook and loop, google for search lmaooo)

Aim is to downregulate the slop
- Accuracy is key, first come first serve is rule of law in organic ideation
	- I.e. if someone just copies somebody elses content but just says it better the OG person gets a cut; perhaps not full rights depending on case by case basis (say if the repeater put a lot of work into it or is a journalist), but at least a cut no?
	- Community notes and moderation will be paramount to this system.
- Factor in time spent
	- Time spent learning, creating, doing
	- the time will already be recorded per content consumed and note taken, just use it again to calculate this
		- Can one track the time it takes to have the ideas if not developing them on platform? (can just promote note-taking and say if its not documented it didnt happen)
	- AI generated content is cool, but should get less compensation due to its nature (lack of effort). Even if its insane quality, should only depend on time and money spent creating the thing (i.e. if you made the AI model ofc you should be compensated for what you created with it,, generative art was a thing way before AI and I think its sick af!! however, the slop just has to go...)


Ideation on compensation calculation:
- Compensation = time spent by users x impact factor (calculated with weights above) x effort factor? x conversion rate to currency of choice
- Utilize time tokens and impact tokens, impact token is the converted token from time with the stated weights and potential effort factor;; idk how one could control the value of the token in this way but we'll figure it out.
	- See [[crypto as backend]] for ideation on how to prevent use as investment and thus decrease volatility


Impact = Aura = Empowerment = Synergy = Symbiote = Antidote = DO2E = ARX


IRL application of impact token outside of digital goods?
- Profit sharing; set royalty based on time spent // percentage of work done developing whatever thing
	- For operators (those who carry out instructions rather than ideate them) sticking to something similar to the bonus and royalty system could still work;
		- If they are x% of the company workforce at that time, they should get ~x% of the profits (not revenue, profits;; one can still set aside cash for research etc.. potentially also just give the workers a choice to re-invest their profit share into the business??? I'm a big consent guy and what a company does with their worker's money should be within the worker's volition. The worker should have the opportunities for financial freedom and risk just like any other business participant!)
	- Quantify the impact of development steps and day to day actions down to the purchasing of parts;; how much immediate value and long term impact do the actions of the operator actually bring the company?
	- each task != same value due to impact
		- roles == value (unless doing different tasks with different impact levels)
		- time == value (unless doing different tasks with different impact levels)


Hardware:
- Later on integrate into line of hardware and potentially make its own OS; user-centric tracking for education only.
	- Microsoft recall on steroids
	- Must be able to install on any hardware (fuck limiting software to hardware and vis versa cough cough apple)
		- linux based? make my own linux distro? yes plsss
	- E-paper and normal devices
		- All can also run linux itself, not just the edu-os
		- NO bloat, core features only (pkm, browsing, tracking, etc.)
			- offer super easy installation of education modules, focus tools, etc.
		- Ergo-split keebs built in?
		- Wonky aspect ratios?
		- portable and non-portable?
		- RIGHT TO REPAIR AND UPGRADE IS A MUST
			- Fuck E-waste, could we use recycled tech for giveaways?
	- Sell self-hosting kits for discounted price if helping support the decentralized network (allow to pay off bill over time with utilization?)
		- Intro to home-labbing?
	- Make a course on how to break out of the EDU OS for power-users once graduated (transition to power-user should be a feature not a flaw of the restrictions in place with any software)
- 

User-agents? See [[how to compensate workers that use AI]]
- Allow users to sell (temp / snapshot) access to brokers if desired?
	- Could be good way for people to make money on the side
	- Alternatively outsource their AE's to do tasks, if their AE does better than others it can be a hot commodity!
		- Find ways to run AI agents without leaking data about the agent itself; turn AE's into contractible agents to work for the user.
