Thoughts on foundational structure:
- Charity is a litmus test for the level of altruism in any collective.
- I will try my best to serve this, but if the people don't want it they wont get it!
	- If people don't fund it they don't deserve it, but I'll do it anyways because I think they need it.
	- If not them then the next generation or the next (but sadly I might not be around to see the impact it makes if it doesn't pick up in my lifetime and thats something I struggle with but will get past.)
	- If I build it it will help at least 1 person: me.
- B-Corp / Nonprofit / not for profit / DAO?
	- TLDR Altruistic Capitalism as focus for the platform; can make money on add-ons but I'm sticking to the platform as a public good mentality.
Are humans fundamentally good or evil? 
- This was a question asked by a group of Christian picketers at the academic plaza a few weeks ago; I had the opportunity to speak with them and came to the conclusion that neither edge case is sufficient, rather we are all imperfect. I argued the nurturing of one individual has a significant result on their actions, therefore lead me to the belief that we are neither inherently good nor evil. Biblical passages such as the allegory of the garden of eden and fall of adam highlight this by insinuating that humanity was a choice, that we had the choice to have the knowledge of the gods (that of good and evil) or eternal life, but had to choose. I find the concept of sin to be irrelevant in this context; yes it was "commanded" not to eat the fruit but yet the fruit tree was still present. In sects that believe in predestination this is even less of a case for free will but that's a debate for another time. The case I brought up is the infinity of time presented by the garden of eden allegory possibly being an argument for predestination // lack of free will in that context therefore making the choice not a choice nor a sin; after an infinity of time, I argued, anything can happen. (See the infinite monkey typewriter theorem and babel image archives for examples of this order within chaos of decision along any infinity.) The same case goes for the existence of earth along the cosmos according to more scientifically apt groups; we are just lucky to be here at this point in time yes, but along a perspective of infinity (in time and possibility) we are guaranteed to be here at some point; if we are more than our bodies that just means we waited for the precise time to inhabit this rock in the forms evolution provided. REGARDLESS: with this in mind my mind goes only to this -> we KNOW nothing. We can only speculate. We dont KNOW if divine influence is true, I can claim to be possessed right now! What we do KNOW is that through the diversification of thought (and along a long enough timeline) we can get enough guesses to approximate some version of the truth;; the scientific method and an inherent/emergent property of scale in action.
	- Hence: The platform should be open to ALL religions, schools of thought, nationalities, and more. Other points of view than that of the Christian majority are REQUIRED to have a more solid understanding of theology;; we must eliminate enumerative BIAS in order to get closer to the truth. (EVEN if Christianity is the one true religion // the facts of what happened // we must grant the other perspectives some validity and the benefit of the doubt. Only then can one determine for a fact that their religion is true.) By forcing an ideology one thinks // believes to be true on another this enables the stated bias, if not amplifies it (knowledge = justified true belief, not just belief. Identity = Belief != not necessarily Knowledge ). Additionally the hatred that builds up under oppression is (and has been proven to be) bound to cause someone to snap and do something they'll regret; that we'll all regret pushing for.
	- "The Human Race"
		- We all suffer from humanity
		- We all eat, drink, think, shit, then die.
		- We're only here for ~100 years each, we need to make the most of it and be open to whatever is next no matter what it is.
	- I am of the firm belief that death is an unknown. Religion is just a speculation of this unknown, a noble pursuit towards understanding this unknown however and should be respected and limited as such.
		- To this we cannot push others towards the unknown as it is an unknown, hence my pacifism. 
		- If you must incite death to understand it, you need to be the one who dies first. (lead by example you pussy motherfuckers;; I can't talk though I fear death and will admit that because I AM human.)
Media Advocacy // [[Outreach]] // [[Subsidiaries and Synergistic partnerships to pursue]]:
- Take Interviews with people I think will be receptive and have a good audience
	- Dua Lipa (her interview hit and if she's into it she does hella research and I respect that hella)
	- Jack Recider - Darknet Diaries (love his content, it's really what got me into tech)
- My Idols:
	- Bill Nye
	- Tom Hanks (at least his characters lmao)
	- Mr. Rodgers
	- Adam Savage
	- Robin Williams (characters and person, watched documentary, so sad but happy)
	- David Foster Wallace (communication as an artform)
	- Basquiat and Andy Warhol (documentary again, very misunderstood people)
	- Michael Reeves (funny, intelligent, entertaining)
	- Jacob Collier
	- Simone Giertz
	- The ancient greeks
		- Plato
		- Socrates
		- Aristotle (?) - idrk, alexander the great was a mishap lmao
		- Oracle of delphi was a crazy concept lmao but mad respect for getting an entire nation to respect a stoner
Note to Publishers, Peer Reviewers, and Academia:
- The times are changing (already have). Publishers in their foundational roles are no longer a necessity. They failed to prevent open access but are in denial (paywalls despite "illicit" resources like libgen, annas archive, sci-hub, thepiratebay to an extent, the internet archive, and the internet itself for that matter) that prove the world's HUNGER for knowledge. Peer reviewers, however, are an absolute necessity to academic integrity therefore should be supported. I propose a separation of the entities mentioned as such; I am of the firm belief that peer reviewers do not do the work to make the research in the first place thus should not have any control over who is able to access it for what price. Contact any academic and they'd kill to give their paper to you, for you to read it and have an actual conversation with them about it. It is their lives you are gatekeeping. We have the tech to revolutionize this industry, just need to use it. LET US HELP YOU.
	- Let us help you compensate academics.
	- Let us help you compensate the peer reviewal process.
	- Let us help you fund the revolutionary research we need to progress as a society.
	- Let us help you garner the attention needed to get the stated funding.
	- Let us help you spread the intellectual wealth to ALL THAT NEED IT (everyone).

Problem vs. Solution contests ("The Colloseum"):
- Various problem categories people compete on to see who can come up with the most feasible and comprehensive ideas/solutions in a set timeframe (limited or even unlimited for ongoing challenges).
- Honorary awards / certifications in challenge areas awarded to the champions
	- If in the academy points towards the respective accolades
	- Funding to start businesses on the ideas made if they so choose, or compensation for the development and acquisition of the pursuits to be distributed to companies in the field.
- Value proposition:
	- integration with network/suite and toolset
- Akin to: aggies invent, Y-combinator, etc. (incubators) but on a global scale. (re-inventing the wheel but with style such that the commonwealth will tune in). Think of it as the intellectual Olympics. 
- Proof this works from national television series:
	- How it's made
	- Top Gear
	- Extreme Engineering (2003 - 2011)
	- Mythbusters
	- Bill Nye the Science Guy
	- Impossible Engineering (2015 – Present)
	- How the Universe Works (2010 – Present) 
	- MORE
- As long as it can be made to be entertaining people will watch it; why not make it for a good cause (like world peace and advancement).
- Quick search for "intellectual olympics" yields tons of people with similar ideas
	- **https://futuristspeaker.com/future-of-education/the-intellectual-olympiad-a-provocative-proposal-for-transforming-higher-education/**

Funding the platform:
- Free to students. Forever. (whilst still students I mean)
- TLDR: COGS is servers, development, compensating creators, and compensating for our effect on the environment. No profit should be made over that for the platform (as a public good). Money can be made on accelerative add-ons --time is our only finite resource-- i.e. games, tools, etc.
- Attempted pricing breakdown for charging customer (businesses, institutions, nations etc.)
	- Low cost to the individual
	- Minimal cost (no profit) for K-12, just ask them to help out where possible
	- "High" cost to private universities until they bring their costs down.
	- Medium cost to public universities (idk, might keep same as K-12, people need higher education and I'm falling into the profit mindset)
	- Medium cost to incubators akin to individual structured into groups, allow for group discount?
- Environmental impact will increase costs until we solve the issues present.
- Alternative funding structure: Advertisements // sponsorships (bleh)
	- For those who purely consume (don't create) and don't want to pay can do the freemium model only up until costs have been comped (i.e. incentivize consumption past the point of having ads / allow for one to just watch a ton of ads at the beginning or something idk)
	- Incentivizes creation or funding of the platform and stimulates the economy (the current justification for advertisements, I still hate them though they're too distracting)
	- See [[2025-04-19 (handwritten notes)]] for more ideas on this, only relevant ads go to user.

	- (Plato and the ancient greeks had that shit on lock tbh I envy that)

Accessibility - Text <-> Speech
- Mobile and desktop, offload processing to servers where applicable (unless privacy is needed, people can locally host and get a discount)
- Allow for as much offline as possible for places with spotty connection
	- Pre-load courses in compressed file type akin to how youtube does it lmao (I really do be just yoinkin their shit but like also spotify does it, any music streamer does it;; its not youtube nor googles IP its the tech industries :P )
- Special Needs Education (need to talk with Mason's Aunt about this, special-ed educator)
	- Recognize learning speed and tailor for all
		- Allocate resources where necessary, regardless of diagnosis
		- (though ofc if extra diagnosis are picked up that system doesnt they are valid and should be accounted for too)
	- For beyond-border of digital help: In-person help is required.
		- Need to make in-person communities and mentorship an imperative.\
	- I was in special Ed (Accelerated Leaning Program) and that shit saved my academic career. 

Context: Curriculum ideas
- Life Skills:
	- Counting Money
	- Paying bills
	- Budgeting
	- Taxes
	- Parenting
	- Mental Health (DBT REQUIRED EARLY ON)
	- Safe Drug Use (for 18+ only? idk, should be a young people thing too; people be smoking shit in middle school ffs)
		- Solution: Parent's choice!
	- Sex ED (for 18+ only? I have less of a holdup on this one; should be taught YOUNG. Accidents happen. Puberty is chaos.)
		- Solution: Parent's choice!
	- Gender / Identity Studies
		- Help them curate their identity and act as a safe space for ideas.
	- Relationship Training
		- Aimed at Preventing Toxicity and Sexual Assault
	- Cooking
	- Political literacy
	- Charity
	- Polyglot / immersion learning via sorting hat weekly stuff (see below)

Map of local resources:
- Low cost clinics
- mental health facilities / hotlines
- food pantries
- wellfare qualification assistance
- pro-bono lawyers
	- immigration law
	- patent law
	- assault persecution
	- etc.

Mental Health is a necessity in this modern day society (always has been always will be)
- We put so many resources into researching this but dont teach it in schools for fuckn why???
- Mandatory testing at all stages of life
	- Provide resources if needed
	- Notify parents IF child consents and is non-life-threatening; ensure this is a logical refusal if so;; cps if need be yk what I mean
- Passively test for learning disabilities
	- Utilize reading speed, comprehension, ideation speed, etc. as metrics
	- Parse against timeframe of child development (I need to learn this by heart)
- Monitor for whatever needs to be monitored for with AI and notify teachers / guardians / etc.
	- Suicidality
	- Sexual Assault
	- Trafficking
	- Abuse
	- Addiction
	- Bullying

Sorting Hat
- Based on verified age, location, stats, and interests; sort into group / communities to then do socratic seminars for course discussion (and irrelevant discussion!).
- Shuffle - Switch it up! (Once a week?) Put kids in conference calls with people all over the world with the same sorting system; give them an objective and let them figure it out (translation etc.)
	- Helps build kids networks
	- Helps kids learn global worldview
	- Helps kids not fall into trap of confirmation bias (of culture, location, etc.)
	- Again (as always) need to consult childhood development experts on how this works specifically as to not harm with this concept.

Peer mentor weekly meetings -> upperclassmen // higher divisions
- everyone pulls everyone else up! 
- The only thing I like abt frats / sorrorities is the community, the way they do bigs and littles is an ingenious idea that can be put into practice at a much younger age.
- Again track interactions for hazing / bullying but like why not??
