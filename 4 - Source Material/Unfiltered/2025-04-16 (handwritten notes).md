- Context: ideating on concept of the [[Memorandum of Understanding]] and gamification of incubators and the reformation of the education system
	- "needs" - take the evaluation structure from FAFSA; they know how to keep you on your bottom line income when in need for real
		- obv tweak as needed and add some actually good customer service // serve yourself center lmao
		- Def need to back up FAFSA if theyre going to take down the DOE; it has some good // redeeming qualities (calculators // resources etc.)
	- Akin to [[GTFO Housing]] meet the needs then kick out once done
		- at that point they can self sustain; babying becomes a limitation in and of itself after a certain point
		- Limits are amazing for creativity; but I think inciting // allowing suffering is taking it too far.
		- What differentiates from the current system:
			- Teach but have mercy.
			- This shit is currently merciless; why not have a safety net that is a baseline of human needs???
- Context: compensation models for teachers // learning system developers
	- Fetch and attribute learning strategies to all who developed them then distribute funds to them!
	- Time split like as in [[Memorandum of Understanding]]
		- Time spent developing = split of funds.
		- blockchain smart contract for attribution should be able to support this.
- AI source maintainer is a must:
	- Differentiate between fact and interpretation (talked about more in EQ group notes)
	- This is a must to trust AI tools; im a big "make the AI make algorithms for everything that we can understand as you implement them into critical infrastructure" kindof guy; blackbox is cool but you have NO control.
	- Why not use AI to make the systems themselves at a lower level? Agentic AI is dope conceptually
- FUNDING IS HARD
	- Initially (as mentioned previously) depend on crowdfunding, freemium model, and the cyclical nature of funds if sticking within ecosystem (cryptocurrency sadly might be the answer in this case)
		- CAVEAT I NEED TO BE CALLED OUT ON::: I am "loving the solution" on my blockchain path; I just feel that it has all of the qualities required to actually make this thing work:
			- Accountability, Attribution, Automation, and Autonomy.
	- Long term: make a public good and fund with taxes once overhead has been properly mitigated. If one can make a backup of everything then its truly free.
		- Charge for services around not the content within
		- This could be done by hitting up the government and just asking to help make a new DOE!
			- DO_2E -> "Decentrallized Organization of Education"
			- AntiDO2E (antidote)
- Context: Cons of losing the university
	- Sports?
		- Have people build their own teams! Privately owned sports teams makes so much more sense than educationally funded IMO. Its a skill, the players are paid; its a fucking business.
			- Yes pay for athletes education if thats what they want; but why force them into academia if they dont want to be there? we dont want anyone here that doesnt want to be here.
		- AKA I believe in the privitization of that sector, but dont think education should be fully privatized (can have plenty of competition by its augmentation if that is free to occur however)
		- 
- Teach kids how to make money from the get go if money is life;;
	- If you have them incubate ideas from their origins when they truly have imagination then they can make such cool shit
	- Even if its nonsensical at least they'll have fun (let them be kids whilst they're kids!!!)
	- Ideally fostering this throughout primary and secondary education could solve the issue of education funding; they build their own funding system for higher education (if a full reform of higher education does not occur)
	- Not a perfect idea; 
		- "assumes all kids have this skillset and it fails those who dont"
		- I would have to disagree to an extent however; I believe that everyone can market themselves; work on their own brand (we all do it without thinking of it!). It is very much a learnable skill, not something entirely nature. 
		- One could argue that a scarcity mindset is required for innovation; to that I propose the following:
			- The only truly relevant scarcity is time.
				- With time there will come innovation; we have become that which decades ago we labeled as sci-fi and I defend the prediction that the same will occur in the next couple of decades to that which we label as sci-fi now.
				- We can overcome the energy crisis
				- We can overcome the material scarcity crisis (even if it means leaving this planet)
				- We can overcome climate change with the solving of that which is above.
				- Everything just takes time.
				- I propose an acceleration of that timeline such that it can happen within our lifetimes.
				- I want to live in the society I write about, therefore I will not sit on my ass and just write about it; rather write it as I create it in this reality.
