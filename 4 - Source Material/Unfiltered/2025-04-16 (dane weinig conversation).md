VALID DATA
	Filtering between old and new information; valid research methods etc.

AI
	Lacks warmth and community
		Publically fund the above
	Expensive (energy, noise pollution)
		Throw into space lmao

Federalized systems
	Finland is his fav

Child education with AI is bad connotation; focus on human intervention layer and note the subtleties that allow the child to prosper in their desired path.
	AI aptitude testing throughout education.

Jose wanted me to look into singapore for meritocratic society

Innovator != creator -> make it a creator pump.
	Creation != productization; anything that can make an impact is a worthy creation
		i.e. art, media, writing, lower-level non-automatable labour (all still have an impact and move society forward thus are noble pursuits we should encourage if the student is a good fit for it.)

It was mentioned that the long term may pose a new issue; how can this be funded // generate money after innovation has reached its conclusion?
	Context: the concept of the model being a source of competition for who can create the best AI // algorithmic // whatever tools to increase the utility of this system grinding to a halt as a result of monopolization / a dominant party than one cannot top. 
	I find the assumptions behind the question appalling (that innovation can ever truly cease) but will entertain it for the sake of the argument.
	I believe at that point it would become a contest of rates; the rate of funding vs the rate of innovation. If it becomes un-sustainable to fund the innovation private businesses will step in to continue funding akin to how it is now;; the concept of signing away your time later for short term gratification.
	However, I think that the nature of this toolset // system would prevent such a thing from being a bad thing; if the models are open for all to use one can just use that dominant model to assist in the endeavor of creating the next best thing. Thats really what I'm doing right now! ChatGPT and the other LLM players are revolutionizing the way information is delivered to the masses; they are those key players in the thought experiment, though that isn't stopping me rather enabling me to create something at this scale; giving me faith we can keep up with the acceleration (albeit requiring significant effort and alignment within goals). 

I am trying to provide light to the world; I want to be an optimist because if I'm not then who will be? My goals may be lofty, but I genuinely think they are realizable with the assistance of everyone impacted by what we will create!

This can be a community effort, we don't have to sit back and wait for someone to save us; in fact we cannot.
