ONYX sync not workin lmao; going to just type up and scan in later

Page 1:
- Time Based Economy
	- Users: set base time in wallet per sub-platform / category (education, music, entertainment)
	- 1 token = one hour? or can do as minute as seconds even
	- Time is spent with every second, even if idle (feeds back to platform fund if not spent anywhere else)
	- No way to spend more time other than multi-consuming (i.e. separation of funding pools between music and other other forms of content might be required)
		- If not separate funds, split time based on attention factor? or just even split idk.
	- Regardless, creators receive this token and cash out on a cyclical basis
		- Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
			- Incentivize longer cycles to lower volatility of the token value
				- rebates 
				- better rates token value rates
				- expedited processing fees
	- Under the assumption that most creators will consume content as well, they recieve the same baseline as users; same token but excess at end of cycle is what is cash-outable
		- perhaps set minimum account balance for continuing access to consume; if cashed out block access to public good until the next month / cycle.
			- ACTUALLY NO; cannot go below account balance for consumption; otherwise would then have ability to account farm and just leech funds (side hustle to pay people to not access resources lmaooo)
			- But maybe? would incentivize people to gtfo of platform when only used for entertainment; this should be addicting / fun but we want people to live lives off-platform... (unlike most social media these days).
				- Just have to differentiate between use cases; for students cannot go below minimum account balance; for charity cannot go below minimum account balance (for serving underserved); but for individual fuck it why not its their money.
				- ~DAO decision-point~ - cost of token (proportionally the amount creators get) to be controlled by token sinks and faucets
Page 2:
- But how does this time-based token gain  and keep economic value?
	- Funding sources:
		- Taxes (if public and federally funded)
		- Non-student user fees
		- sponsorships (companies pay to be shouted out; aka advertisements but I hate advertisements in their current state so that is a no-no word lmao)
			- Separate sponsorships per focus type because that shits mad distracting and annoying if not relevant (education, music, entertainment, shopping, etc.)
				- Ex: within education focus only allow for relevant educative resources to be shown to the user
				- think of it like the platform is providing a resource rather than shoving a product down the user's throat.
			- Advertisers get their money back if nobody was on topic to receive their product recommendation
				- reduces risk of their investment (thus can incentivize small businesses to run advertisements without fear of it burning their runway inefficiently; currently feels like a gamble unless you have an SEO professional and entire fucking marketing team behind your ads being created)
					- This isn't meant to displace the SEO people and marketing people though; the quality of the ad will be directly proportional to the click-through rate if there is a product-consumer fit to be found; just doesn't waste the valuable resource that is all of our time on hitting a goddamn quota to make a fuckn buck (yes google I'm talking to you).
				- increases effectiveness of ads without needlessly showing the ad to people who dont give a fuck just to hit a quota
					- Our service should perform at least to the ability of google AdSense in that as such because it really does just shove shit down your throat hoping something sticks.
				- allows us to mobilize funds whilst they are waiting on us to find someone interested in their product; be transparent about this!!! 
					- we don't want to get caught with pants down though so they've gotta lock into a set timeframe for the product-consumer fit search to run and pay an expedition fee if they want the cash back asap
Page 3:
- Overhead is not entirely avoidable sadly:
	- Server costs
	- Our employees salaries (if still even doing salaries in this new economic framework... compensation nonetheless)
		- Content taggers and Moderators
		- Course coordinators
		- Mentors
		- Developers for when bugs get rampant (esp if everyone is on this itll be fuckn BUGGY at first)
	- Likely will also need to fund carbon credits to offset use of AI
		- ~DAO decision-point~ - which credits / methods / how much of an offset (ideally 100% offset but if can afford more then fuck it lets use this platform to solve climate change too :) )
