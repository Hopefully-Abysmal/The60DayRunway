## Misc. Notes
- "overlapping minds"
- Perception -> Cognition -> MetaCognition (Self governance in a loose sense)
	- Concept of this metacognition as the removal and placement of nodes with purpose
		- Within PKM this is what would allow AE's to be user trainable!
	- "overlapping minds" -> Matching of knowledge systems to find likeminded people
		- By doing so, can create synergy "reduce entropy" within a social development context; my goal is to accelerate technological development so this is a really good lead
- CommonAccord - Law documents as wiki lmao; fuckn fire.
	- "Codification" of concepts - not too specific, not too general; just to build commentary and interpretation around it.
		- Similar to strands of knowledge
