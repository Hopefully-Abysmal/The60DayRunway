-  **Write Vault Content**
    
    - Standardize use of headers and bullet points in Obsidian notes:
        
        - `# Project`
            
        - `## Feature`
            
        - `- Task`
            
        - `- Motivation`
            
        - `- Quality`
            
-  **Consolidate Vault**
    
    - Create script to merge all vault `.md` files into a single file `Consolidated_Notes.md`.
        
-  **Parse Structure**
    
    - Build `parse_structure.py`:
        
        - Parse headers and bullets.
            
        - Output `structure.json` (machine-usable tree) and `structure_visual.md` (human-readable).
            
-  **Generate Folder Tree**
    
    - Create one folder per issue with:
        
        - `issue.md`
            
        - `issue.json`
            
    - Maintain parent/sub-issue hierarchy in folder structure.
        
    - Enforce Windows path length limit (<260 characters).
        
-  **Semantic Classification**
    
    - Implement local LLM (Phi/Ollama) pipeline to classify snippets into:
        
        - `Task`
            
        - `Quality`
            
        - `Motivation`
            
-  **Fuzzy Matching and Routing**
    
    - Match snippets to existing issues or projects using `fuzzywuzzy`.
        
    - Create new issue if no match found.
        
-  **Issue Expansion**
    
    - Detect sub-issues from nested bullets.
        
    - Determine task ordering based on logical/temporal dependencies using LLM inference.
        
-  **Blocker Detection**
    
    - NLP scan for "blockers."
        
    - Auto-link dependent issues based on fuzzy matching.
        
-  **Export for GitHub**
    
    - Generate `issues_export.json` in the correct format for GitHub API.
        
    - Include fields:
        
        - repository
            
        - issue_title
            
        - assignees
            
        - status
            
        - milestone
            
        - labels
            
        - parent_issue
            
        - sub_issues
            
        - linked_prs
            
-  **Optional GitHub Upload**
    
    - (Optional) Build upload script to push issues to GitHub via REST/GraphQL API.
        
-  **Snapshot and Resume System**
    
    - At every major processing stage:
        
        - Save human-readable `.md` snapshot.
            
        - Save machine-readable `.json` snapshot.
            
        - Maintain a `/snapshots/` folder for fault tolerance.
            
    - Include full LLM cache output and context inside each issue folder.

# Re-pass Instruction

## Me
Remember that whatever I have written is already published, might need to seek 3rd party publishing but all of this is being done publically. Reduce redundancy with a single global tasklist within the canvas formatted in a markdown checklist, don't worry about seperating the properties of the work anymore; just ingrain them into the tasks themselves. We are at the stage of initial business plan development, I have drafted the early funding models, need to finalize the business plan and MVP for submission in June (2 months from now). Main focus would be platform development and some accelerated learning tools (BII and Interphrase should be easy enough). Please assist in the following endeavor; I am going to re-pass everything you just generated to you with the goal of creating a global to-do list on the canvas as a table (include task, relevant notes, and blockers). In order to ensure chronological order I would like you to slot in the to-do items in the order where you would best see them being completed; as I am very ecclectic the order in which I provide them to you will have little bearing on when they need to be done; just based on when I had the idea. I have made a prompt splitting script but would like you to tailor the chunking prompts that surround the processable chunks to fit this endeavor:

### My Pre-prompt
I need you to create a global to-do list based on the following information (chunked into parts). Please re-format and differentiate the following chunk into actionable items and qualities the project is to have.

### My Post-prompt
I need you to create a global to-do list based on the following information (chunked into parts). Please re-format and differentiate the chunk I just provided into actionable items and qualities the project is to have.

## GPT Pre-prompt:
I need you to create a global to-do list based on the following information (chunked into parts). Please re-format and differentiate the following chunk into actionable tasks, embedding important project qualities directly into the tasks themselves. Consolidate into a single canvas in **chronological execution order** with each task having:

- Task (what to do)
- Relevant notes (context, linked initiatives, special requirements)
- Blockers (what must be resolved to move forward)

The project is already public, and the goal is to finalize the **initial business plan and MVP** for submission in June (two months from now). Major focus areas are **platform development** and **accelerated learning tools**. Please maintain focus on deliverability and fast iteration.


## GPT Post-prompt

I need you to create a global to-do list based on the following information (chunked into parts). Please re-format and differentiate the chunk I just provided into **actionable tasks** with **embedded project qualities**. Consolidate into a single, **chronologically ordered** canvas structured as a **table** with:

- Task
- Relevant Notes
- Blockers

The work is already public. The immediate goal is **finalizing the business plan and MVP for June submission**, with a primary focus on **platform development** and **accelerated learning tools** (BII and Interphrase).
