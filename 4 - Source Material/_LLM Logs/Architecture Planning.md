The following is going to be a LONG prompt; with everything I have written thus-far such that I can get organized whilst planning the architecture for the development of the platform. Strap in and enjoy the ride!!

# Compilation of everything relevant:

Scripting this lmao fuck that.

Can you draft me a script to consolidate all of the notes in my zettelkasten to one markdown note?

Please format such that the title of the note is a title within the note (i.e. "# title") within the note link format (i.e. "[[Memorandum of Understanding]]")
If titles exist within the note bump them (all headers within that file) up one level (i.e. "## subtitle")

# Me

Ok I now have the consolidated notes; please script the splitting of the LONG context note (29485 words) into short context with repeated prompt and overlap
- EX: make a global to-do list in canvas based on the following data; separate currently actionable ideas from future ideas.

Perhaps a JIRA integration would be beneficial for this if advisable.

# GPT

Alright! Here's a Python script that will **split your long consolidated Markdown note into smaller context chunks**, each with:

- A **fixed word count limit** (you can customize it),
    
- A **repeated prompt** at the top of each chunk, and
    
- An **overlap** between chunks to maintain context continuity (configurable),
    
- Output files written to a `/chunks` folder for organization.
    

Then I’ll show you how this can be used as input for a global canvas To-Do or a JIRA integration afterward.

---

### ✅ Python Script: `split_consolidated_note.py`

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import textwrap

# === CONFIGURATION ===
input_file = Path("Consolidated_Notes.md")
output_dir = input_file.parent / "chunks"
chunk_word_limit = 1000        # words per chunk
overlap_word_count = 150       # words of overlap between chunks
repeated_prompt = "Make a global to-do list in canvas based on the following data; separate currently actionable ideas from future ideas."

# Ensure output directory exists
output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

def split_text_into_chunks(text, chunk_size, overlap):
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(words):
        end = start + chunk_size
        chunk = words[start:end]
        chunks.append(" ".join(chunk))
        start += chunk_size - overlap
    return chunks

def save_chunks(chunks):
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        filename = output_dir / f"context_chunk_{i+1:02}.md"
        with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(f"**{repeated_prompt}**\n\n")
            f.write(chunk)
        print(f"🧩 Saved: {filename.name}")

def main():
    if not input_file.exists():
        print(f"Input file does not exist: {input_file}")
        return

    with open(input_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        full_text = f.read()

    chunks = split_text_into_chunks(full_text, chunk_word_limit, overlap_word_count)
    save_chunks(chunks)
    print(f"\n✅ Total Chunks Created: {len(chunks)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### 📁 Output Folder:

Each file will look like:

```
chunks/
├── context_chunk_01.md
├── context_chunk_02.md
├── ...
```

Each starting with:

```
**Make a global to-do list in canvas based on the following data; separate currently actionable ideas from future ideas.**

[content here...]
```

---

### 🧠 Next Step: Use in Obsidian Canvas or JIRA

#### 👉 For Obsidian Canvas:

You can create a canvas and link each chunk like:

````markdown
```canvas
[[chunks/context_chunk_01]]
[[chunks/context_chunk_02]]
...
````

#### 👉 For JIRA Integration (Optional Advanced):

We could:

- Use the Atlassian API to POST new tasks with summaries pulled from each chunk
    
- Classify them into “actionable” vs “future” with a GPT model locally or via prompt
    
- Tag tasks with project names, priorities, etc.
    

Let me know if you'd like a `JIRA_Integration.py` next — or if you want the chunks preprocessed into task summaries!


# Me

I was thinking about potentially just running something local actually; I'm familiar with ollama and can boot up an instance of Phi or something. If advisable could you make a script to split into even smaller context chunks utilizing the bullet level of the text? Allow for overlap but cull irrelevant tokens to the task; would need to find some way to detect and reduce redundancy for human readabilty but I was thinking I would have a folder full of files for each task to document ideas within each task and the processes I take to build the feature out. Dont wanna do JIRA cause thats off-platform; just trying to reverse engineer it on obsidian with markdown lmaooo.

So tldr: script chunks it yes, but make that chunking more intellegent; if a note relevant is already made add it to that note; if not make a new note. From there we can do global note-prompts to be like "state the scope considerations given that this is for the development of an MVP" and from those results have the to-do list organized. Potentially also automate which tasks are blocked by what. Please advise.

// meh output, directed it to fuzzysearch (thank you lainey) //
# GPT (after a couple iterations)

Perfect — this fuzzy-matching setup is a strong addition, and ideal for your use case since LLM outputs are inherently variable. Let’s upgrade the `smart_task_splitter.py` to include:

- Fuzzy matching using `fuzzywuzzy`
    
- Automatic fuzzy search against existing task titles (instead of exact match)
    
- A lightweight document registry (e.g. JSON index of task titles and tags)
    
- Optional embedding of task "tags" (e.g. concepts mentioned in the bullet) for improved matching later
    

---

## 🧠 New Features

### ✅ Task Matching Now:

- Checks against an indexed JSON of all task filenames and inferred tags
    
- Uses fuzzy matching (via `fuzz.partial_ratio`) to avoid duplicates and append intelligently
    
- Still hashes content for uniqueness fallback if no match found

### 📦 Dependencies:

```bash
pip install fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein nltk
```

## 📁 Folder Output Example:

```
tasks/
├── Task - Build auth workflow (0e12ca91d1b2).md
├── Task - Configure embed viewer (9d0cfa18f273).md
├── task_index.json
```

Each file will build naturally over time as you re-run the script.

## 📡 Next Moves?

Would you like a follow-up script to:

- Add frontmatter (`scope`, `depends_on`, `status`) using Ollama locally?
    
- Generate an **Obsidian Canvas** or graph view of task dependencies?
    
- Sync note structure to an auto-generated index or roadmap doc?
    

Say the word and I’ll hook you up with the next piece in this workflow 💡
