# The Start of an Obsession

## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHuqhQmc4ok

UGHHHH, I wish I could have a conversation with this guy.

> "There are seven-year-old kids today playing with macroeconomic models. You can debate the content of those models, but one thing is undeniable: these kids will sit for hours, learning and experimenting through play. We need to keep improving our models—making them more sophisticated—but this kind of interactive learning is something none of us had growing up. Thousands of individual experiences are being built, all grounded in a shared set of core principles."

"The problem was you can't ask Aristotle a question."

Did steve jobs journal?? If so we need to get an AI of this mf STAT;; quite curious if this is achievable. Like off all of the content online of his essence

Steve Jobs @ MIT 1992 - "What's the most important thing that you personally learned at Apple...?"

>"That's a great question. I'm not sure I learned this directly at Apple, but I came to realize it there through experience and reflection. The biggest lesson was this: I now take a much longer-term view on people. In the past, when I saw something being done wrong, my first instinct was to step in and fix it immediately. Now, instead of focusing on fixing the problem myself, I think about how to build a stronger team for the long run — not just for the next year, but for the next decade. So the question I ask myself is: _What can I do to help this person learn and grow,_ rather than _how do I solve this problem right now?_ It's not always easy. That impulse to jump in and fix things is still there. But exercising patience, and investing in the growth of others, has probably been the most profound shift in my mindset. And honestly, some part of that change might just be biological — the result of time, experience, and maturing as a leader."

```

Thank you.  
I am deeply honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.

Truth be told, I never graduated from college.  
This is the closest I've ever come to a college graduation.

Today, I want to share three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal — just three simple stories.

---

### First Story: Connecting the Dots

I dropped out of Reed College after six months but stayed around as a drop-in for about 18 more months before truly leaving.

Why did I drop out?  
The story begins before I was even born.  
My biological mother, a young, unwed graduate student, decided to put me up for adoption. She insisted I be adopted by college graduates. Everything was set — until the adoptive couple backed out because they wanted a girl.

In the middle of the night, my future parents — neither of whom graduated college — were offered a baby boy. They said yes. My biological mother only agreed to the adoption after they promised that I would go to college someday.

Seventeen years later, I did.  
But I naively chose a college almost as expensive as Stanford, spending all my working-class parents' savings.  
After six months, I couldn’t see the value.  
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life — and no idea how college would help.  
So I dropped out, trusting that things would somehow work out.

It was terrifying.  
I slept on friends' floors, returned Coke bottles for food money, and walked seven miles for a good meal once a week at the Hare Krishna temple.

Yet following my curiosity turned out to be priceless.  
For example, Reed College had the best calligraphy instruction in the country.  
Because I was no longer taking required classes, I took a course in calligraphy, learning about typefaces, spacing, and the beauty of typography.

At the time, none of it had any practical application.

But ten years later, when designing the first Macintosh, it all came back.  
The Mac became the first computer with beautiful typography — and, since Windows copied the Mac, every personal computer owes something to that calligraphy class.

You cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.  
So you must trust that the dots will connect in your future.  
Trust in something — your gut, destiny, karma, life — because believing the dots will connect will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.

And that will make all the difference.

### Second Story: Love and Loss

I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early.  
Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20.  
In 10 years, Apple grew into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.  
We had just released the Macintosh and I had just turned 30.

Then I got fired.

How do you get fired from a company you started?  
As Apple grew, we hired someone to help run it, and at first, things went well.  
But our visions diverged, and eventually the Board of Directors sided with him.

I was out — very publicly out.  
It was devastating.  
For months, I didn't know what to do.  
I felt like I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down.  
I even thought about leaving Silicon Valley altogether.

But something slowly dawned on me:  
I still loved what I did.  
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

So I started over.

Over the next five years, I founded NeXT, founded Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who became my wife.  
Pixar went on to create _Toy Story_, the first computer-animated feature film, and became the most successful animation studio in the world.

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned — the technology we built at NeXT now powers Apple’s renaissance.

None of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired.  
It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith.

The only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  
You must find what you love — and that goes for your work as well as your relationships.  
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.  
Don’t settle.  
As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.  
And like any great relationship, it only gets better with time.

So keep looking. Don’t settle.

## Steve Jobs on Death and Following Your Heart

**My third story is about death.**

> When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."  

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.  

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

**Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.**  

## Steve Jobs on the Whole Earth Catalog and Staying Foolish

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called _The Whole Earth Catalog_, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.  

Stewart and his team put out several issues of _The Whole Earth Catalog_, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: **"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."**  

It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.  

**Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.**

Thank you all very much.

# Steve Jobs on Consulting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c4CNB80SRc

```markdown
Many of you come from companies where you've already gained work experience, right?  
How many are from manufacturing companies?  
_(Audience responds.)_  
Excellent. Where are the rest of you from?

How many from consulting?  
_(Audience responds.)_  
Ah, that's not ideal.

No, seriously — I don’t think consulting is inherently bad. It’s not evil.  
But without owning something — owning a project or product over an extended period of time, across multiple stages — you miss out on a lot of real learning.

You need the experience of making decisions, seeing your recommendations implemented, dealing with the consequences — the mistakes, the setbacks — and picking yourself back up. You need to accumulate the _scar tissue_ that only comes from living through the whole cycle.

When you're consulting, you might make recommendations, but you don't typically own the results. You don't own the implementation. That limits the depth of what you can learn.

Consulting gives you a broad exposure to companies — but it’s very thin. It’s like looking at a picture of a banana.

You might have a very accurate, detailed photo, but it’s still only two-dimensional. Without actually doing it — without the hands-on experience — you never truly grasp the three-dimensional reality.

So, you may end up with a lot of pictures to hang on your wall — "I've worked in bananas, I've worked in peaches, I've worked in grapes" — but you never really taste any of them.

And one more thing: as a consultant, you're a variable expense.  
In tough times, companies often start by cutting variable expenses.

Just something to keep in mind.

# Steve Jobs Secrets of Life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw

```markdown
". . . The thing I would say is, when you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But life, that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. And the minute that you understand that you can poke life, and actually something will, you know, if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it. You can mold it. That's maybe the most important thing is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it, versus embrace it. Change it. Improve it. Make your mark upon it. I think that's very important. And however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better. Because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."
