Underserved -- lasso of opportunity (who can be reached)
Underrepresented -- refers to choice in opportunities

"Its about choices"
	Army as an alternative choice example

"You need to be able to market your options for education to underserved populations"

"The problem with providing choices to underserved populations, is a communication issue."
	"We don't know why they're underserved"
	Tools of communication
		need to regress to reach them
	"I dont know what I said untill you tell me what you heard"
	"Ask: How do you define freedom? Democracy?"
	"Look to history, what brings people together?"
		I would say entertainment; the story is what has brought communities together for millennia
	Run a mission analysis
		Need statement: Message them
		Mission, constraints, risks, tasks implied and specified, of those which are essential  (everything else needs to nest under).
		At that point can develop courses of action.
		PUFFAR
			Can do.
			As opposed to a victim attitude
		Attitude is a must on the part of the people given the opportunities

Bootstrapping; someone gave them options
	Be that mentor

"If you dont have access you dont have access"
	WIFI and hardware

Landgrant university
	Mission to reach underserved populations

Anecdote
	Military experience and application of all of the above
	

///

Relevant points on my end I brought up:

tech (social media as tool for garnering attention, communicating through the tools already in place)
	I dont think its a hardware problem anymore; almost everyone has phones (he stated even in Afghanistan!) and if they dont I envy them to an extent lmao
	It was mentioned that its just the hardware does not necessarily grant the insight to utilize them for productivity.

Afterthoughts:
elementary school on up not just higher education
