Look into blitz scaling

Apparently it is the perfect antithesis to what I want to make.

Example: Spotify

Yapped about my ideal setup; next steps, and the concept of individual ownership of IMPACT, not the companies. Companies as entities can still be utilized, shareholders can be left intact; but the people that make the business happen must be aptly compensated for their long term impact in order to allow them to retire. Afterthoughts:
	We make shit up like social security to compensate for the lack of systems like this
	We pay taxes to pay for those who can no longer work because they couldn't create the passive income we all so crave.
	We all need to put in the time and effort to get to the point of security, but that security must be secure in its attainability!! 
	In this current job market security is not a secure assumption; if you get fired or your reputation gets tanked sucks to suck! Guess you have to live out the rest of your life striving to get what you once had!? Go work a dead end job, lie down and take shit for the rest of your life? I'd argue that that blow can be softened! The stakes do not need to be this high!?!?
	By tracing and extending the compensation along that of the lifetime of one's impact; it prioritizes impact over just paying the bills at that moment. The paycheck to paycheck mentality is fixed at the systemic level.
