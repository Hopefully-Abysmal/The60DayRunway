**Version 1.0**  
**Last Updated:** May 1st, 2025  
**Applies to:** All contents of this repository, including but not limited to source code, documentation, creative works, research notes, designs, and concepts.

---

## I. PURPOSE

This license governs the use of all materials within this repository (hereafter referred to as “The Project” or “The 60 Day Runway”) and any direct or indirect derivatives. It serves as a protective declaration for the contributors and community members co-developing a transparent, non-exploitative system of creative survival and public empowerment under **The ARX Foundation**.

This is not just an open-source license — it is a public pact. One built on radical transparency, mutual trust, and equitable contribution.

---

## II. RIGHTS GRANTED

You are **free to**:

- ✅ **Use** the contents for personal, educational, or commercial purposes that align with the core values of this project.
- ✅ **Modify** the materials to build derivative works.
- ✅ **Share and distribute** your modifications, provided they remain under this license.
- ✅ **Attribute** the original contributors with credit and clarity.

---

## III. CORE CONDITIONS

You agree to the following as a user, contributor, or observer of this work:

### 1. **Transparency and Documentation**
- All meaningful use or adaptation must clearly indicate **who**, **why**, and **how** it is being used.
- You must disclose:
  - Source attribution (link to original repo and author)
  - Description of modifications or uses
  - Intent behind use or deployment

### 2. **No Patents Without Consent**
- **You are explicitly prohibited from filing for patents** on any invention, process, system, or derivative of this work **without the express, written consent of Landon Dahle** or an elected representative body of The ARX Foundation.
- Any patents filed without such consent are **invalid, unenforceable**, and in direct violation of this license.
- We reserve the right to initiate community action or legal opposition in defense of shared intellectual heritage.

### 3. **No Exploitation**
- You may not use any part of this work to:
  - Build closed-source systems that rely on public contributions without return
  - Participate in extractive labor practices
  - Obscure authorship or deny access to future contributors
  - Contribute to surveillance, misinformation, or oppressive structures

### 4. **DAO Transfer Clause**
- Upon fulfillment of the initial goals (escape from student debt, sustainable housing, and creator-owned income), all major tools and services birthed through this effort must be prepared for **transfer to a decentralized, community-governed organization (DAO)**.
- This ensures continuity, non-ownership by any single person or company, and alignment with public needs.

## IV. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

You must clearly acknowledge The Project in any derivative work:

> “Built with and inspired by The 60 Day Runway // The ARX Foundation — founded by Landon Dahle”  
> [https://github.com/hopefullyabysmal/The60DayRunway](https://github.com/hopefullyabysmal/The60DayRunway)

For public or commercial use, this notice must appear:
- On your website or documentation
- In any product README or About page
- Wherever legal licensing information is typically presented

---

## V. COMPENSATION AND FAIRNESS

- **Time-based equity models** used in this project reward effort, not just ownership or access. If you adopt a similar model, respect its philosophical intent.
- Contributions made by others must be **credited and not absorbed** into a singular narrative.
- Monetary gain is not discouraged — **hoarding is**. Take only what you need, and uplift others when you can.

---

## VI. ENFORCEMENT & COMMUNITY ACTION

If a person or entity:
- Violates the core values listed above
- Attempts to privatize shared tools
- Sabotages the project or exploits its visibility

Then The ARX Foundation — or its proxy community — reserves the right to **revoke usage privileges**, pursue takedown requests, and organize collective resistance. This pact is enforced by the most dangerous defense any cause can ask for: people who care. (And lawyers if needed but be not afraid if you align with the vision.)

---

## VII. DISCLAIMER

This project is provided **as-is** and without warranty of any kind. The contributors are not liable for any damages resulting from the use, misuse, or interpretation of this content.

---

## VIII. FINAL NOTE FROM THE FOUNDER

This project is about survival through creativity, and the belief that systems of mutual care can outperform systems of profit.

If your goals are aligned: **Welcome aboard.**  
If they aren’t: **Please step aside.**

Let’s build something new — together, in the open, for everyone.

— Landon Dahle  // Elryan The Explorer // 
Founder of The ARX Foundation
