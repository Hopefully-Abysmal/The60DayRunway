# I. PREAMBLE

The ARX Foundation Public Pact (AFPP) is a values-based license designed to promote creative survival, transparency, and mutual care. It serves not only as a legal instrument but also a moral compass. Where enforceable by copyright and contract law, this license asserts the terms below. Where not enforceable, it calls upon collective moral and community action. This license may be interpreted in harmony with permissive or copyleft licenses (e.g., MIT, GPL) so long as such integration does not violate AFPPâ€™s ethical stipulations.

---

# II. PURPOSE

This license governs the use of all materials within this repository ("The Project" or "The 60 Day Runway") and any direct or indirect derivatives. It is a protective declaration for contributors and community members co-developing a transparent, non-exploitative system of creative survival and public empowerment under The ARX Foundation.

This is not merely an open-source license â€” it is a public pact built on radical transparency, mutual trust, and equitable contribution.

# V. OPTIONAL MODULES AND EXTENSIONS

## 1. Fair Use Commercial Trial

You may use this project and its outputs for commercial purposes for up to **thirty (30) days** to evaluate alignment with your goals. Beyond that period, continued commercial use requires adherence to all conditions of this license â€” particularly Sections III, IV, and V.

Commercial trials apply per organization, not per individual.

## 2. Definitions of Personal and Noncommercial Use

The following do **not** constitute commercial use:

- Personal research, study, or hobby projects
- Religious observance or artistic experimentation
- Academic or public-interest research
- Use by nonprofits, cooperatives, educational institutions, or public service organizations, regardless of funding source

## 3. Patent Shield Clause

You agree not to initiate legal claims against any contributor or user alleging that this project, in part or whole, infringes on any patent. Doing so voids your rights under this license until such legal proceedings are concluded â€” and may result in indefinite revocation depending on the outcome.

## 4. Attribution Grace Period

If you fail to provide appropriate attribution or licensing notices, but do so **within thirty (30) days** of being notified, you will be considered in compliance retroactively. This does not apply to willful concealment or bad-faith actions.

# VII. COMPENSATION AND FAIRNESS

- If you adopt the impact/time-based equity model from this project, you must honor its intention: reward effort over ownership.
- Contributions by others must be acknowledged; do not absorb them into a singular narrative.
- You are welcome to profit â€” but hoarding is discouraged. Take what you need, give when you can.

---

# VIII. ENFORCEMENT & COMMUNITY ACTION

Violations include:

- Breaching ethical core values
- Attempting privatization of shared tools

In such cases, The ARX Foundation or its proxy community reserves the right to:

# IX. DISCLAIMER

This project is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. Contributors are not liable for damages from use, misuse, or interpretation.

---

# X. FINAL NOTE FROM THE FOUNDER

This project is about survival through creativity â€” and the belief that mutual care can outperform systems built solely for profit.

If your goals align: welcome. If they donâ€™t: respectfully step aside.

Letâ€™s build something new â€” together, in the open, for everyone.
