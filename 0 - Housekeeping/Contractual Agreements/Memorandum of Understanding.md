## I. PURPOSE

This is not a job. This is not entertainment. This is the coordinated, intentional rise of a better empire ‚Äî a non-tyrannical revolution grounded in trust, transparency, and mutual support.

We are building a system where **people come before profit** and **only take what they need**. If we succeed, we will have proven that shared action and mutual care can outcompete extractive, individualist systems ‚Äî using the very tools they gave us.

---

## II. PHILOSOPHICAL ALIGNMENT

To **fully participate**, you must share and uphold our foundational values:

- **Use money and tools for good**, not exploitation.
    
- **Take only what you need** ‚Äî no hoarding, no greed.
    
- **If you try to exploit or sabotage the effort, you will be respectfully removed.**
    
- **If your goals are aligned, you are welcome. If not, step aside.**
    

You are not required to believe everything I believe ‚Äî but you must not act in opposition to the vision: equitable access, mutual uplift, and creative autonomy.

## III. STRUCTURE OF ENGAGEMENT

- This is a **temporary, collaborative heist** ‚Äî completely legal, fully transparent, and entirely fueled by trust.
    
- You may leave at any time. Once the work is done, we may part ways freely.

## IV. TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT

1. **Open Source Commitment**  
    Upon completion and fulfillment of all individual needs (to be defined via group consensus), the tools, services, and assets created will be released under an open license and managed by a **Digital Autonomous Organization (DAO)**.
    
    - No participant holds exclusive IP rights to shared assets.
        
    - You may reuse and build upon your contributions elsewhere, as long as you respect open source principles.
        
2. **Documentation Requirement**
    
    - All contributions must be documented through our **team Zettelkasten** and **video-recorded logs**.
        
    - Time logs will be verified by a neutral third party.
        
    - You may opt out of public visibility by:
        
        - Using a **working pseudonym**
            
        - Requesting **facial scrubbing, voice modulation, metadata removal**, etc.
            
3. **Compensation Model** ‚Äì _Time-Based Equity of Need_
    
    - Funds raised will be distributed according to verified time contributed.
        
    - **All time is valued equally** unless adjusted by the following modifiers:
        
        - üß† _Pre-existing IP Bonus_: +X% (to be negotiated)
            
        - üï∞Ô∏è _Overtime Rate_: +50% of split percentage earned per hour for hours beyond 40/wk
            
        - ‚è≥ _Failure Modifier_: After Day 60, if group goals are unmet, contribution rate decays by X% per hour/day
            
            - Intended to create urgency, not punishment
                
            - Note: If evolving into an ongoing thinktank with housing or makerspace support this would be the gimmick.

## V. FINAL NOTES

- This agreement is based on **trust and shared intent**, not legal threat.
    
- We are building something new. If we succeed, it will be because we believed we could ‚Äî and because we **shared it all**.
