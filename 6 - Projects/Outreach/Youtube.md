# Why have smart-contracts not been utilized for monetization yet?

I want fair and transparent compensation for creators and feel I am not alone in that pursuit. I am working on a novel way of going about information delivery --that being the root of education-- and compensation for those that create the information to be delivered. I want to assist in the reform of the education system and feel Youtube as a platform is in a very significant position of opportunity to step in and assist; the platform itself is amazing, I use it every day, and has inspired me to pursue this endeavor.
