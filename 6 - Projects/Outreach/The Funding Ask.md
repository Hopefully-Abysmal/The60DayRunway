# 📢 Funding Request: Help Us Build the Future of Education

Hello,

If you’ve received this, it’s because you’re someone close to me — someone I trust, and likely someone in a more stable financial position than I am right now.

I'm currently building something that I believe could reshape education for the better. It’s called **SCOOL: the Scalable Community for Open Online Learning**, and it's not just a product — it’s a platform, a philosophy, and a long-term solution to a broken education system.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR (Too Long, Did Read)

I'm launching a community-driven, AI-powered education platform during a 60-day sprint ending **June 30, 2025**. This is my all-in, do-or-die window before I may be forced to take a traditional job, which would drastically delay development.

To get this off the ground, **I’m asking for short-term support**:  
- **Not investment** (I can't promise financial return)  
- But **contribution** — through platforms like [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hopefullyabysmal), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/HopefullyAbysmal), or direct sharing.

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

SCOOL is a **decentralized, creator-owned learning platform**. It merges:

- 📚 **Open-access educational content**
- 🧠 **Personal Knowledge Management**
- 🤖 **LLM-based tutoring & insight tools**
- 🔄 **Algorithmic feeds to promote meaningful learning, not clickbait**
- 🏛️ **A DAO structure for community ownership**

We’re trying to **transform social media from a slot machine into a school** — one where learning is engaging, personalized, and credible.

## 💸 What We Need (and Why)

Here’s a transparent look at our **immediate financial needs**:

| Need                | Purpose                                      | Estimated Cost      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| LLC Filing          | Launch Hopefully Abysmal + ARX Foundation    | $750                |
| Domain Purchases    | Secure branding & prevent cybersquatting     | $500                |
| Web Hosting         | Public MVP & backend infrastructure          | $500                |
| Storage (NAS)       | Proprietary research & local backups         | $2,000              |
| K8s Credits         | Run scalable AI tooling for MVP              | ~$500–$1,000        |
| Basic Living        | Rent, food, etc. post-June 30                | ~$2,500/mo          |

**Total Needed Pre-Launch:** ~$5,000  
**Total Needed for 2-Month Runway post-challenge:** ~$10,000–12,000

## 🛠️ What I’ve Already Committed

- 💸 I’m putting my **remaining student loan funds** into this.
- ⏳ I’m dedicating **every waking hour** to build this platform.
- 🔧 I’m doing all initial dev myself, and open-sourcing the code.

This is not a hobby. This is a **launch plan**, not a moonshot.

---

## 🧩 How You Can Help

**1. Fund it if you can:**  
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hopefullyabysmal): one-time or recurring donations  
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/HopefullyAbysmal): for monthly support
- Direct contribution through known means is welcomed for friends and family 

**2. Share it widely:**  
Someone you know may care about education, tech, or community enough to chip in.

**3. Join the mission:**  
If you're a dev, researcher, educator, or artist — reach out. This is meant to be **creator-led and creator-benefiting**.

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters

With **school vouchers, privatization, and AI-driven misinformation** on the rise, we need a counterforce. SCOOL isn’t meant to replace public education — it’s meant to **save what’s left** and **build what comes next**.

We envision:

- Micro-learning hubs per neighborhood  
- Teachers empowered, not automated out  
- A public, permanent archive of human learning  
- A **platform I myself want to use**, because I’m building it for people like me.

This is personal. This is urgent. And this is possible — but only with help.

---

## 🫱 Final Words

I don’t want to do this alone. And I can’t.  
If you care about education, community, or helping someone escape the trap of debt, stagnation, and wasted potential — consider joining me now.

Let’s build something worth learning from.

**Thank you,**
