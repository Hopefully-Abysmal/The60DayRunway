# Why I Continue

This document outlines the philosophical and strategic motivations behind the creation of this platform, the Runway, and the Arx Foundation.

I believe that the deliberate de-funding of public education, alongside the suppression of accessible knowledge resources, puts the next generation at risk — intellectually, economically, and culturally.

Existing systems like Anna's Archive, Sci-Hub, and LibGen have already decentralized access. What we need now is:
- A [[Compensation methods|legitimized attribution and compensation layer]]
- A [[crypto as backend|crypto backend]], not frontend — to protect users from volatility, but allow value to flow freely
- A [[README|collective mission]], not just a tech stack

## A Note on Strategic Demand Reduction

Some (myself included) have interpreted economic signals (military spending, education cuts, wealth hoarding) as **preparation for conflict or supply-side control**. 

Whether true or not, this effort is not an act of rebellion — it is an act of *resilience* that is only meant to secure our futures akin to the defense initiatives y'all aim to defund our infrastructure to support.

I propose that instead of stifling access, we fund open education as:
- A **public good**
- A **defensive infrastructure**
- A **platform for recruitment, training, and inspiration**

This could be co-sponsored by national initiatives (like DOGE), and provide secure, localized versions for defense teams — while ensuring public versions remain sovereign and community-owned. The lead of the DOGE initiative Mr. Elon Musk is also in a strategic position to enable one of the key value propositions of our platform; aptitude analysis via content consumption patterns through social media-like algorithms.

## Why Publish This?

Because I want to live in a world where:
- We don’t hide our motivations out of fear.
- Transparency is not a threat — it’s a testament.
- If they come for us, it will be clear **what we stood for** and **what we built**.
