## Call for Submissions

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping industries, economies, and societies at an unprecedented pace. The exponential growth of AI technologies offers new opportunities and challenges for businesses worldwide, enabling enhanced decision-making, efficiency, and innovation. We believe AI will be a critical piece of new ventures that will develop products and services that change the world. At Mays, we are committed to supporting AI’s capabilities to produce new products and services that build a better future.

To that end, Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School — in collaboration with the College of Engineering, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Architecture, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Texas A&M Innovation — invites individuals and teams of undergraduate student founders nationwide to submit business plans that leverage AI to address real-world challenges. Eligible individuals and teams must be currently enrolled undergraduate student founders from any major at any university and no more than four members can be on one team.

From the business plans submitted to the competition, judges will identify the top 24 entries. Those individuals and teams will be invited to present a 10-minute pitch to a panel of three judges through a virtual format. From those 24 entries, the judges will identify the top 12 nationwide and they will be invited to come to College Station for a final in-person pitch.

Submissions are due April 30, 2025.

Mays is proud to have support for the competition from Deloitte* and the Deloitte Foundation through individual contributions from Deloitte Texas A&M alumni matched by the Deloitte Foundation.
