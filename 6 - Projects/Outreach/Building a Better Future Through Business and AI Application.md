# From The Beginning
## The Immediate Problem:

The talks of defunding the department of education (doe) struck fear into my heart for future generations. Acts like “School Choice” and the push towards privatized education were publicly framed as ways to allow for those underserved to have the choice to attend private schooling, an opportunity they wouldn’t otherwise have, an opportunity too good to pass up. This idealistic notion proves to be insecure upon further examination, however; if parents choose these private schools they inadvertently remove the ability of the public schools their children once utilized to support themselves, an outcome seemingly designed to cull the already underfunded public schools from existence. 

According to the [Texas Public School Finance Overview](https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/texas-public-school-finance-overview.pdf), the funding of Tier One schools is based largely on Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the number of students enrolled at the school (and has been that way for hundreds of years, often at stagnant rates despite rising associated costs, but that’s another discussion). As such, when a student leaves, the public school loses funding — even if the school’s fixed costs (buildings, teachers, buses) stay the same. (TLDR: School choice can hollow out traditional schools without reducing their operating costs, leading to budget crises.) On a similar yet even more daunting note, students in programs like Special Education (SPED), Bilingual Education, Compensatory Education, and Career and Technical Education (CTE) come with extra funding weights to meet their needs. This means that if these students leave for charter schools or accept these private vouchers — if charters only selectively admit less expensive-to-educate students — public schools lose the weighted funding but retain the responsibility for the highest-need students left behind. (TLDR: Public schools become concentrated with higher-need, underfunded populations, worsening achievement gaps.) Furthermore, Programs like Transportation, New Instructional Facilities, and Early Education depend on having large enough populations. If enrollment drops from choice programs, it becomes too expensive to justify running a bus system, early education centers, or to build new facilities. Sparsity adjustments only partly solve this — districts will struggle when below critical mass. (TLDR: Fewer students means lost services for the kids who stay in public schools.) My final critique (for the very top level issues) is that vouchers and charters often require parental navigation, transportation, and sometimes upfront costs that lower-income families struggle with. Wealthier or more informed families exit first, taking not just their ADA but also community advocacy and political support with them. Public schools become de facto segregation zones for the poor, minorities, and disabled students. (TLDR: Instead of empowering all families, school choice can concentrate disadvantaged youth to public schools, likely condemning them to a life of further disadvantage.)

Despite these faults in need of addressing, however, there seems to be a silver lining; an opportunity to do better for our youth. All of our problems boil down to education when you think about it; the events that occur during one’s childhood development in specific have such a strong hold on the people we become. I myself was a public school attendant, and feel slighted by my experiences within. The scale of these schools and the lack of funding resulted in the inability for teachers to spend meaningful one-on-one time with students, escalating issues like bullying, general disinterest, and ineffective learning especially among students with undiagnosed learning disabilities like myself during that time. 

The Heritage Foundation wrote a [very insightful report](https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/here-are-10-reasons-school-choice-winning) on the potential benefits of the school choice that I will be utilizing to inform my counterargument. My understanding of the points made is as follows. On the concepts of freedom and customization: families can tailor education to student needs (e.g., disabilities, giftedness), requiring the family to take accountability for their children’s education—to "vote" with their feet and dollars. This could theoretically increase parental satisfaction, graduation rates, and civic outcomes stated (was shown to do so in a [case study from 2013 over the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/EDFP_a_00083)), thus improving engagement, involvement, and happiness with their children’s education. However, this freedom dooms public schools further as they are bound by the archaic regulations imposed by years of systemic development. The framework proposes it could allow one to escape unsafe or failing schools and provide access to opportunities for low-income families by breaking zip-code-based barriers. I would argue that unless the policy covers relocation costs this does not necessarily apply to the intended audience, however; the rising costs of housing disallow this choice on a financial level, thus making the opportunities seemingly unachievable for those suffering from the ailments we aim to address. The proposed system is aimed at taxpayer savings and economic efficiency; vouchers/ESA programs are often cheaper than public schooling, yes, but putting the financial means back into the pockets of parents does not necessarily allow for the previously stated choices for those in positions where the reduction of taxes cannot permit action regardless. If implemented incorrectly this could strand a non-insignificant portion of our next generation of students rather than save them. 

The final and main point to this I want to address is that of market competition—where I see the silver lining and the beauty of the policy. By implementing the policy, the economy is utilized at scale to force all schools (public and private) to improve. That is where I believe we can step in; we can utilize the technology at our disposal to ensure that this transition can be beneficial for all, that we can use this opportunity of educational systemic reform to do just that: reform. 

## Expanding The Scope:

I am of the firm belief that business as we know it is essentially a solved game. All one must do is set up systems such that others pull the weight and one can prosper exponentially; systems that can be taught and utilized at will by those in the know. Especially now with the rise of natural language processing (NLP), the large language model (LLM), and the opening of knowledge (surrounding business development, economics, and more) as a result of the internet; we all can—and are starting to—make our own businesses surrounding any and all ideas we deem novel and worthy. I digress, however. Under this belief, one structure that is a pillar for this game being (and staying) solved is exploitation; perhaps not as you know it (slavery, indentured servitude, etc.) but on a systemic and societal level against that of the working class.

The phrase "boss makes a dollar while I make a dime, that’s why I shit on company time" is a sentiment I hold deep in my heart, engrained through my years of fast food and other grunt work. When the worker has no stake in their endeavors there is no true incentive to innovate, to improve, rather we stagnate--"shitting" on the company time that takes up over half of our waking hours. The nature of the work and its proposed value do come into play; when too many unskilled laborers are present the value of unskilled labor decreases, that’s simple supply and demand. However, I would argue that there is more to an economically focused society than just that. We aim to sustain ourselves and our offspring, but in the conditions presented we honestly cannot do so. 

One might argue that this is by design; that we hold this to incentivize workers to enhance their skills and dig themselves out of the holes we put them in via the avenue of higher education. To utilize this avenue, however, often requires digging one's hole into a pit, a chasm even; the cost of our higher education system strands our struggling working class in cyclical loops of debt, all under the illusion of choice that we had an alternative provided to keep us under economic control. What are those alternatives though, I ask. Continue working at your dead end job until you can afford to better yourself? Go to a school of lesser stature to factor in affordability (risking the lack of any clear benefit as such due to lack of network, quality of education, even a worthy job at the end)? Apply for scholarships and depend on the community's charity to present you with an opportunity in the roulette wheel that that seems to be? Go to the military, some big company, or private financial institutions and have them pay for your education only to be indebted to one's entity of "choice" for the rest of your limited lifetime? To this I implore you to consider, are these really the best choices we can give to our underserved populations?

The system I critique does work; we have advanced this far as a society and I can applaud that, but we got here at a cost. A cost to our collective mental health, a cost to our quality of life, and a cost to our financial infrastructure (see the amount of debt this country is in ffs). It feels we are keeping ourselves in a survival loop; constantly putting each other down to get ahead, a literal rat race. To counter this being proposed as an ideal solution to progress however, I would argue that innovation does not necessitate suffering! COVID proved we don't necessarily need the institutions as we know them, the internet provided a safety net at a scale previously unknown to our society and can act as such going forward if we just figure out how best to use it to the potential I believe it to possess. I believe knowledge should be open for all, rather it already is but we're just in denial of it.

To further explain my reasoning I need to back up to the motivations of innovators and entrepreneurs of the past. The concept of passive income is alluring to all as the key to financial freedom, especially to us entrepreneurs and ideators as we fall in the position of circumstance to actually realize that desire. For those outside of the circumstances required to become entrepreneurs the concept of bonuses and retirement are all that are left. The essentials of passive income but with the caveat of its propensity for the manipulation of the common man; the perfect motivation: to not have to suffer any longer, to be out of the chasm built, to be free from the systems we employ.  I would argue that these incentives are merely a bandage on the gaping wound that is the income inequality between the business owner and the working class; a tool to be utilized as leverage for loyalty of a worker to a brand, something that can be taken away the moment it doesn't serve it's benefactor. 

I am of the firm belief that the roles of CEO and founder are akin to any other job, however will digress to an extent that the agency and risk that comes along with it is what can give it a higher value than that of mere operators in our current reality. As such we need to cultivate a society of less inherent risk in order to allow for a culture of innovation to prosper! I believe that we should all be working towards passive income; that being the creation of self-sustaining structures of progress and innovation is a noble endeavor that needs to be fostered for true progress and societal acceleration. A society of creators is a society of innovation. In the scenario provided, the business becomes merely a way for one to realize dreams into reality through the power of a collective of like-minded individuals (as it is in its purest form), not a source of power, not an avenue to remove our fellow man’s autonomy, a cyclical tool for the acceleration of our society as a whole.

All this to move onto the point I wanted to make: we can support the development of passive income for all, but it starts with allowing the worker to realize the impact of their actions and be aptly compensated throughout the course of that impact's life (essentially a re-work and implementation of the royalty concept at scale). Plenty of caveats to this could arise, but I have not the foresight to address them all. One that immediately comes to mind is that one must be able to cease their contributions to any endeavor at any time; the work they put in does not lose its value as a result of one doing so, so why should we insight the punishment of one acting out of self preservation? We have already cracked down on non-competes; this is the next logical step in the war against monopoly and stagnation. Through this long term compensation we incentivize meaningful contribution. Via the freedom of vocational choice proposed we incentivize loyalty to one's individual values through the dissolution of the barrier between company culture and our societal culture as a whole. These issues aren't just economic, they're social, societal, and cultural. But there is reason for hope; as an engineer I believe every problem has a solution, its just a matter of time and effort. I implore you to continue your perusal of this proposal, and help where you can. We can make the world a better place. We can build the lives we want to live within our lifetimes. Our only truly finite resource is time. I plan to apply this structure within my own endeavors as a living example of what our free market could be; starting with my own experiences and desires: to reform education and content creation. 

The academy falls back all the way to 387 BCE (platonic academy in specific), the ancient Greeks and their epistemic philosophy laid the ground rules for academic pursuit, Plato and his interlocutors still have influence on our culture to this day. This brings forth two main concepts: that education is ancient and that we can do better. Dating things back to the time they were created and understanding them as such can go a long way; they thought the universe revolved around us for heaven’s sake (pun intended). Their philosophy was our foundation, and we have worked from there; but also who’s to say we did a good job? Or that they did a good job? With the technology at our disposal we can patch the flaws of our societal models as we deem fit; specifically I aim to address that of educational scale. The ancient Greeks had no concept of the internet, therefore they couldn’t design an education system around it! But we do, can, and should. We are globally interconnected! We can solve academic and systemic issues with only our minds (as I hope to exemplify). We each (assuming you have a smartphone) own computers orders of magnitude faster and more computationally advanced than that which brought us to the moon that can fit into the palms of our hands! It’s time we realized the power we truly hold and utilized the systems we have access to to make the world an even better place. But change must start with education: how we learn, how we think, and how we live. 

## The Solution(s):

Personal Knowledge Management systems like Obsidian and Notion have been all the rise for productivity in my generation and those above me in the corporate world. 

Ground news and wikipedia prove that the people are striving for a more informed world; a world devoid of misinformation.

Youtube and social media platforms prove that aptitude

Novel governance structures like the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can allow for this to be sustainable as a public good. I don’t believe I have the right to profit off the backs of other’s work and neither should you; by merely integrating all of these systems, yes I (and whoever helps on this endeavor) make an impact and can be compensated for it, but the same depreciation strategies apply to everyone. I believe where profit can ethically be made is within the concept of organic novelty; by building the systems in the way I describe, a marketplace for accelerative learning tools arises. This marketplace will prove to be a battleground for competition, for innovation on how we can better suit our needs as intellectuals and learners, there is money up for grabs! Under the philosophy that time is our only truly finite resource, being able to utilize that time to the fullest extent possible becomes an imperative, a luxury with an associated cost willing to be paid by its users until that luxury becomes the new bottom line.
