To legally operate "Hopefully Abysmal LLC" in Utah, focusing on creative works, web development, and a t-shirt side hustle, you'll need to address both state and local licensing requirements. Here's a breakdown:

### ‚úÖ State-Level Requirements

1. **Business Registration**
    
    - Register your LLC with the Utah Department of Commerce.
        
    - This process will provide you with a business entity number.([LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-get-a-business-license-in-utah?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Get a Business License in Utah - LegalZoom"), [codev.utahcounty.gov](https://codev.utahcounty.gov/business-licensing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Obtaining a Business License - Utah County Community Development"))
        
2. **Sales Tax License (Seller's Permit)**
    
    - If you're selling tangible goods (like t-shirts), you must obtain a Utah Sales and Use Tax License.
        
    - Register online through the Utah State Tax Commission's OneStop Business Registration system.
        
    - This license allows you to collect sales tax from customers and is also necessary for obtaining a resale certificate.([SellerPermit](https://www.sellerpermit.com/answer/How%20To%20Get%20My%20Sellers%20License%20In%20Utah.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How To Get My Sellers License In Utah Clothing Store"), [Yonda Tax](https://yondatax.com/state-sales-tax-rates/utah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Utah Sales Tax Rates & Compliance | Yonda"), [LedgerGurus](https://ledgergurus.com/sales-tax-for-dropshippers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Sales Tax for Dropshippers | Compliance & Exemption Strategies"))
        
3. **Resale Certificate**
    
    - To purchase inventory (e.g., blank t-shirts) tax-free for resale, complete Utah Form TC-721, the Sales Tax Exemption Certificate.
        
    - Provide this certificate to your suppliers to avoid paying sales tax on items you intend to resell.([TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/blog/use-utah-resale-certificate?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to use a Utah resale certificate - TaxJar"))

### üè† Local-Level Requirements

Even if your business isn't physically operating out of your father's address, using it as your registered agent address may still subject you to local business licensing requirements. Here's what you should consider:

1. **Business License**
    
    - Most Utah cities and counties require businesses to obtain a local business license, regardless of whether the business is home-based or operates online.
        
    - Contact the city or county where your registered agent address is located to determine specific licensing requirements.([LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-get-a-business-license-in-utah?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Get a Business License in Utah - LegalZoom"))
        
2. **Home Occupation Permit**
    
    - If any business activities are conducted from a residence, a home occupation permit may be required.
        
    - This ensures that the business complies with local zoning laws.
        
3. **Zoning Compliance**
    
    - Verify that your business activities are permitted under the zoning regulations for the address you're using.
        
    - Some areas have restrictions on business operations in residential zones.

### üõ† Additional Considerations

- **Web Development Services**
    
    - Typically, web development services are not subject to sales tax in Utah.
        
    - However, if you sell any digital products or software, those may be taxable.
        
    - Ensure you understand which of your services or products are taxable to comply with sales tax regulations.([Utah State Tax Commission](https://tax.utah.gov/sales?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Sales & Use Tax - Utah State Tax Commission"))
        
- **Registered Agent**
    
    - Using your father as your registered agent is acceptable, but ensure that he is aware of any responsibilities, such as receiving legal documents on behalf of your LLC.
