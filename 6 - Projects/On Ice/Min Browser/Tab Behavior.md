Want to be able to middle click to close tabs, also need to be able to drag tabs to other monitor for split monitor setup if not using built in monitor sectioner (need hotkeys to move to split view or second monitor?)

Unless is the goal of the browser to force you to focus on one thing at a time which could be a cool feature that I currently view as a flaw due to my conditioning.

Single monitor superiority
