Ideation on names for the new education system:

The School of X (if Elon turns out to be chill like that and lets us use the backend of X)
The ARX Portal (if we have to bootstrap this shit we get credit lmao)
DO_2E (pronounced dote as in antidote lol; stands for decentralized organization of education)
The ARX (pronounced Arch like noahs lmaooo), augmented reality experience?
The Corpus -- all human knowledge
The Library of ARX
	The ARX Library
The Web (3.5?) Of Reality
The Stranded Web - we as humans are stuck on this planet constrained by our material scarcity and time; analog to the web as in the internet; the web as in the OG decentrallized p2p net, the web as in our interconnected network of humanity. Strands are individual paths :)
