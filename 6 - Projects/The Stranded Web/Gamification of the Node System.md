I think the node exploration system can be expanded upon and gamified!

^ this is the system in obsidian; snapshot of the vault rn (more soon to come ofc)
One game made a system for this that I quite enjoy:

The above is a screenshot from their potion creation minigame; one traverses a web of attributes for the potion to attain whilst exploring a world covered by a fog of war.

Similarly [In Other Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Other_Waters) utilized a similar approach graphically, but had a storytelling element that I KNOW could be utilized

>Sub-idea for history and teaching decision-making skills; a simple game of what-if with AI on historical subjects; ask the student to put themselves in the shoes of the historical decisionmaker and gauge if they make the same decisions as them; if not what would they have done differently and why? (Yes if they know the answer theres a bias; but hindsight allows for foresight)

I think the analogies to education are apt; as one does not know what they don't know until prompted to learn it.

A system that could utilize this concept is one akin to the node system but on a scale of the entirety of our knowledge corpus. 

Visualization can follow that being explored in [ðŸ§  - Digital Epistemology](https://www.are.na/nxlounojeoi/digital-epistemology-_9-enrrd6cq)

Potential for differentiation of visualization is endless; see what catches on fastest and is easiest to use!
