# The platform from my mind to paper (screen):
Activity hub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform
Blockchain smart contracts - traceable, transparent, and soon to be accepted method of attributing impact to creators and rightfully compensating them.
	Solves AI content training problem too so added bonus lmao
	I propose as a peace offering to the current platforms that we offer this open source; allow them to use it, may the best platform and community win the user's time!
Algorithms based on SEO and the social media doomscrolling machine
	We want education to be addicting! To be entertaining!
	We all WANT to help the human race, we as humans just crave the drug that is dopamine and have found it in short form content.
		So lets give the people what they want, short form content if they so choose but modular content served with PURPOSE.
Proprietary aptitude model / algorithm
	Think DND stats; we all want strength 20 (100 if talking bloodborne / fromsoft shit)
	Apply that model across all disciplines; let the user rack up points for each discipline as they interact with the platform (consumption, creation, documentation, interpersonal interaction, etc.) and get certified at various milestones along mastery pathways
		Current education system does this but super inefficiently
		Those who want to pivot should be able to; otherwise they wont find their fit in society and will not be fulfilled by their work (my goal is to enable this fulfillment)
	Keep a log of this all and build business end to allow one to utilize everything they have consumed as their resume; I am a firm believer in the mindset that we are what we consume,, akin to the mindset of you are who you surround yourself with but in the age of the internet we are surrounded on all fronts so dont really get to choose what influences you.
Focus centered interface
	Lockdown browser type shit // like logging into a VM
	Find ways to ultra-refine the content people consume for their betterment; with full consent however.
	The concept of user-defined censorship is my prerogative; think reddit / discord spoilers, you can always interact with irrelevant content but only if you choose to do so (as it is a distraction one could potentially negatively reinforce this but I dont really like that)
	



# Subsidiaries // Synergistic partnerships to pursue:
Activity hub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform

Content creation and distribution platforms :: Youtube (google) / insta (meta) / X / patreon idgaf  - creators that utilize youtube (any platform for that matter) can and should be able to opt to share their content on our platform as well; request their integration with activity hub and if rejected target the creators themselves; the mentality that one cannot do this is just a mental block lmao, we have the ability to contact anyone and everyone on this planet with a few clicks of a button and that is here to stay so fuck it lets use it for good.

Content creators themselves :: I really want to reach out to all of my favorite musicians and designers to ask for help / to use their music / designs in marketing this (from the people for the people as is the true American ideology ~ from the creators for the creators) 

Knowledge platforms :: Khan Academy / udemy / individual education content creators
	Incentivize with novel compensation platform (and don't limit them to our platform!!!)
		Little to no risk unless the platforms try to clap back and cut their monetization but if they do that they are greedy fucks that deserve to lose their community.
	My list is down below

The Government :: The Department of Education // DOGE - I just applied for DOGE this morning but if they are already trying to reform the education system lets save them the time and effort lmao (and save the time and effort that went into creating the DOE in the first place; if just shut down thats such a waste IMO)

Content creation tools
	Give creators an edge!
		Figma
		Adobe

LLM tools:
	OpenAI, ollama (meta), grok (X), claude, perplexity, you name it (too many these days);
	Offer to have them all integrated and the user gets to pick (compensate the AI companies accordingly but like fuck it why not???)
		Train a model to switch between models per task agentic style if need be

Education institutions:
	Yes this may "make them obsolete" but it doesnt have to end their existance altogether at all!?!?
	The business side of things is great; they as institutions are great; I just disagree of the conflation of finances and learning in the way that it currently is.
	Additionally the communities built are priceless; the Socratic method only works when interlocutors interact and collaborate towards the fundamental pursuit of knowledge.
		Sadly the overhead of in-person activities is hard to reduce; the in-person schooling may become a luxery; but thats just a problem we need to try to solve later on down the line. As of now if we can reduce the clutter of course managment and certification I think that will make an immense dent in the cost of in-person education anyways; so fuck it we ball.
	Offer our tool as a backend to them to use to help their students prosper; as a tool to connect students with their ideal pursuits.

Personal favorites:
Are.na - board view integration;; art content etc
Github - request hosting assistance whilst we get things set up; 
Uploadthing // Theo - t3.gg - love his content and think he'd be down to help out with hosting if github falls through
Leanstack - creation pipeline that can be integrated
Obsidian - personal knowledge managment system (free!) with amazing community; def think they'd be down for it to be integrated if it isn't charged for.
	If not can just prompt users to go get it themselves and just use it...
	Direct the user to define a folder to call home to their second brain and build our own stuff.
	Local-hosting personal information is an imperative to true security (ofc backup and sync but can use github / offer our own backups if they want to share their data with us; its an issue of trust).
