# 🧭 How to Use the Continuity Plan Template

This template is meant to help you create a **resilient fallback strategy** in case of emergency — personal, political, environmental, or digital. It's a calm, proactive way to stay grounded in uncertain times.

---

## 🔹 What It’s For

- **Emergency relocation planning** (local or international)
- **Data continuity** (keeping your work and knowledge safe)
- **Income backup** (remote-friendly or sovereignty-focused work)
- **Project survival** (Runway Lite for your mission or business)

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Duplicate the Template**
   - Use Obsidian’s template plugin or just duplicate the file manually.
   - Rename it something meaningful like `Continuity – *location*` or `Runway Plan – Collapse Scenario`.

2. **Fill in the Blanks**
   - Use `{{fields}}` as prompts to input:
     - Where you are now
     - Where you can go
     - Who you trust
     - What you need to survive and keep building

3. **Link It**
   - Backlink from your daily notes or core vault index:
     - `[[Continuity – *location*]]`
     - `[[Vault Redundancy Protocol]]`
   - Optionally add to `Map of Content (MoC)` or `/Master Index`

4. **Review Regularly**
   - Schedule a reminder to check/update this every few months.
   - If you move, change jobs, or build new systems — **update this file**.

5. **Optional: Publish**
   - Share a sanitized version (no location or real names) as a public post.
   - This builds collective resilience and might help others prepare their own plan.
