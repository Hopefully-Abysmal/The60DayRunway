Market pressures exist to spark innovation, but are they truly a necessity? "I enjoy living in a nation where being poor sucks because it makes you get out of poverty" is a sentiment I've heard; I have to disagree though, is suffering required for progress? If there cannot be a world where necessity is met for all and desire is the primary motivator then Im out of ideas.---

# PREFACE

Love me some good economic concepts like idealist capitalism, the library economy, and socialism to an extent. Regardless of how demonized any of them are theyre all good at heart (I hope); the creator was trying to make the world better through the power of systemic change!!

> [[Socialism vs Communism|GPT Coming in clutch for my linguistic failure differentiating socialism and communism]]; I am a big proprietor for private ownership so bleh communism, but kindof yay socialism? Fear that this will get me canceled though...
> Perhaps the concept of communal socialism? That being small communities that own means of production for their own product/service/subsidy? Akin to hunger games but actually cool lmao

Im trying my hand at making some myself:
- [[The Human Library]]
- [[The Library Economy]]
- [[Creation, Time, and Impact Based Economy]]
- [[The Commune]] 

I know the only way to make change is from within, so I am embarking on my way through entrepreneurship! I hope all of my businesses can reflect my ideologies and potentially infect people to convert to being more charitable. I know that the systems in place were built on exploitation, and hope that I can withstand the pressures I will face along this endeavor. We shall certainly see!!

Whatever you find in this vault is honestly fair game to take your own stab at; I do maintain however that whatever is done must be transparent and non-profit if I am not involved, and that I retain the rights to the contents as their creator in that case that it is not and I must step in to intervene. Let this not dissuade you however, as long as you are honest with your intentions I will support any and all endeavors akin to mine, as we are all affected by the things I want to change. Any positive change on the listed topics is much welcomed if not required for one to live in a truly amazing society, so lets make my ideas realities!

# A love letter to idealistic economics
It is often mentioned that there are significant differences between idealistic and realistic capitalism, that typically being the human aspects of its implementation (true labor costs, exploitation of developing nations, corruption, and greed per my top level understanding). I would like to argue against the current push / regression towards feudalism with this rant however, as idealistic capitalism really shouldn't be that unachievable with some tweaks to its current implementation.

Borders cause a lot of issues, first being war, second being trade disputes, third being the classification of other nations as lesser than ones own (a fundamental mistake that likely caused the flaws we see today). We are all the same species, human, and must treat each other as such.

The accumulation of wealth is another issue, often viewed as a feature of capitalism however; the concept I would like to propose is that of a question: "how much does one (individual, business, nation, market) really need?". If this question can be addressed with frameworks, one could effectively redistribute the top-level accumulation we currently see.
	Retort: Economic redistribution can cause more harm than good; if I work to get to the point I need to get to then why shouldn't I get to keep my money?
	Counterpoint: That is a perfectly valid, reasonable, and justified position; however you are not the target of this. The true target is those who utilize immoral means to achieve this. Redistribution in my eyes is not a robin-hood endeavor; rather the attribution and fair compensation of those who worked with you to get you to the point you will be at when this could apply to you. Through novel technologies (blockchain as a HUGE proponent) the effort put into any given product is brought into the limelight; the individuals who contribute to this can have tracability within their individual impact; and thus they can be compensated fairly for that impact.
	I am of the firm belief that our time is all equally valuable at its baseline; what you do with that time is what truly enhances its worth in any economy. I plan to test this theory with the concepts stated prior; traceable impact as a multiplier for how one should be compensated.
	See [[Creation, Time, and Impact Based Economy]] for expansion.

Overconsumption is rampant, if quality (well made, reparable, recyclable, truly owned) goods can satisfy the urges behind this then I think the markets would equilibrate. Societal pressures are a blessing and a curse, we must use them to push back against that which is "cheap" (fast, poorly made, planned obsolescence, not truly in our best interest). 

I am of the belief that my generation has been set up for failure (but has every tool we need to succeed). We have never worked so hard for such little incentives in the course of recorded humanity. Im not even one who should be talking about this, as an American (albiet raised lower-middle class and "financially independant" meaning I have a lot of fucking debt) I have the seeming long end of the stick; so you may ask: why am I complaining? The reason I feel my opinion still has weight is that I can see how the systems in place affect people and I am in a position where I can make change as I am a part of the system in question (my own experience is only a fraction of the pain that occurs, but the fact that it does occur in the first place pains me even more).

My view is that the goal of any generation is to lighten the load for the next, otherwise what is the point to reproducing? (To create slaves to the systems you create? To make your offspring pay the tolls for your mistakes? To bring company to your own misery? To immortalize your bloodline???) 

Imagine a world / society where the things needed to sustain life are a given and ones mental and physical health needs are met, why would you believe that things would grind to a halt? I believe the opposite, if there cannot be a true and utter failure (save that which can be provided as incentive to abide by laws) then I believe the creators will prosper voraciously; more risks can be taken--less mental load will be required to attempt to innovate--and thus progress will become self sustaining. By creating a culture of support and innovation we can move the bottom line up over time, making the next generations better and better until theres theres nothing left to complain about (but even then itll just continue getting better, as we are such creative animals and for damn sure know how to complain). 

Why would we not want to support a system that makes itself better? That makes life easier for all? For that is what capitalism was supposed to be, but as previously stated and alluded to, that is not what it has become in practice. We can make change, and because we can we must. Change starts from within, so I will lead by example, but I hope you can find charity within your hearts to make this road less rocky and not let the bystander effect continue occuring whilst our fellow humans suffer. We build the lives we want to live by living them, so lets start today.
