# ðŸ§  Implementation Blueprint: The Impact Attribution and Compensation Framework (ARX Protocol)

## I. Core Philosophy

At its foundation, this system redefines compensation around _impact_, _effort_, and _time_. It divorces creation from mere productization and recognizes value in education, art, labor, and ideation. Everyoneâ€™s contribution is tracked and rewarded according to its **verifiable effect on others**. The result is an adaptive and transparent royalty system rooted in digital traceability and semantic feedback.

We abandon speculative tokenomics in favor of direct-impact-driven compensation. **No tradeable currency is required.** Instead, platform subscriptions and grants fund a **knowledge redistribution mechanism**.

---

## II. Fund Distribution Model

### A. Direct Subscription Model

- Platform users subscribe using fiat (or stablecoin) in tiers.
- Subscription fees pooled into a **Creator Compensation Reserve (T)**.
- No speculative holding. Users receive **time and impact data access** to be reflected in their compensation, not the tokens potentially utilized.

### B. Impact-Based Payout Formula

```plaintext
T = Total Creator Pool (monthly)
L = Livable Wage Baseline
Iáµ¢ = User i's Impact Score
Î£I = Sum of All User Impact Scores

Base Compensation:
Cáµ¢ = min(L, T * (Iáµ¢ / Î£I))

If Î£C < T â†’ Surplus S = T - Î£C

Surplus Redistribution:
Ráµ¢ = S * (Iáµ¢ / Î£I)

Final Payout = Cáµ¢ + Ráµ¢
```

---

## III. Impact Score (Iáµ¢) Calculation

A blended, modular weight system governed by DAO consensus:

| Signal              | Description                                                  | Notes         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Recall Tests        | Memory-verified retrieval in exams or quizzes                | High weight   |
| Content Remixes     | Derivative works that reuse original content                 | Medium weight |
| Citations           | Links, references, and quotes (in discussion or content)     | Medium weight |
| Vocabulary Diff     | Topic increase in userâ€™s semantic footprint post-interaction | Medium        |
| Saves & Interaction | Passive or engaged saving into vaults                        | Low-medium    |
| Propagation         | Verifiable shares, forks, memetic spread                     | Medium-high   |
| Longevity           | Repeated use across time                                     | Medium-low    |

## IV. Time as a Measured Offering

### A. Conceptual Foundation

- Time is not a currency to hoard, but a sacred offeringâ€”measured, witnessed, and transferred.
- We do not mint tokens, nor allow time to be traded.
- Every second a user engages is a **flowing tribute** to the creatorâ€™s altarâ€”logged, transparent, but non-speculative.

### B. Time as a Mechanism

- Every user is allotted **a defined span of time** per the reality we live in.
- This time flows into creators **proportionally to attention**, without user discretion, without manual tipping.
- Each interaction is recorded and weighed against recall, integration, and resonanceâ€”forming the basis for impact.
- Thus, **brevity with clarity** becomes divine: less time with more  remembered = greater reverence and reward.

## V. Creator Tiers and IP Models

| Tier                | Description                  | Rights                           | Limits                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Public Contributor  | Shares IP under open license | Eligible for full impact payout  | Must allow remix + citation  |
| Private Contributor | Keeps IP closed              | Reduced impact payout            | Cannot receive from remixes  |
| Reverent Retired    | Opts out of monetization     | Public tribute + sanctum archive | Irrevocable (pending review) |

---

## VI. Platform Infrastructure (Semi-Decentralized Transparency)

- **Semantic Graphs** for idea lineage tracking
    
- **User Vaults** to log time, content engagement, and interpretation
    
- **Impact Engine** uses recorded metrics to continuously update Iáµ¢
    
- **PKM-based Exams** to validate memory & integration
    

### A. Transparent Impact Ledger

- All impact scores, weights, and payout distributions are published in a **public audit log**.
    
- Logs optionally mirrored to a lightweight **smart contract** or IPFS system for **global verification**.
    
- Governance rules and formulas stored on-chain to ensure immutability.
    

### B. Attribution Proofs (Optional)

- Users may sign content uploads with cryptographic identity or wallet
    
- Platform can issue **proof-of-contribution badges** with timestamping
    

### C. Global Currency Support

- Payments accepted in fiat or stablecoin (e.g., ETH, USDC) for global accessibility
    
- Payouts optionally converted back into creator's preferred currency or wallet
    
- Smart contracts used only as **rails**, not speculative assets
    

---

## VII. Future Considerations for Globalization

- Transparent audit logs of all impact distributions (mirrored on-chain)
    
- Stablecoin compatibility for global accessibility
    
- Global Livability Index research for eventual cross-region parity
    
- Potential DAO-controlled treasury and reputation-weighted voting

## VIII. Vision Statement

> "Impact is the antidote to obscurity. Let it guide our compensation, our governance, and our evolution."

# ðŸ§  Implementation Blueprint V1: The Impact Attribution and Compensation Framework (ARX Protocol)

## I. Core Philosophy

At its foundation, this system redefines compensation around _impact_, _effort_, and _time_. It divorces creation from mere productization and recognizes value in education, art, labor, and ideation. Everyoneâ€™s contribution is tracked and rewarded according to its **verifiable effect on others**. The result is an adaptive and transparent royalty system rooted in digital traceability and semantic feedback.

---

## II. Impact Attribution Engine

### A. Impact Events (Ranked by Significance, DAO-Weight Modifiable)

- Saving content to a collection
    
- Time spent engaging meaningfully
    
- Vocabulary increase / semantic usage in subsequent content
    
- Citations in:
    
    - Projects
        
    - Discussions
        
    - Exams
        
- Integration in new works:
    
    - Quoting
        
    - Remixing
        
    - Application of provided solutions
        

### B. Attribution Chain

- First idea owner logged by timestamped submission
    
- Later derivations track fractional attribution
    
- If similar but unconnected works arise, collaboration proposed; if denied, impact-split proposed; if denied, public tribunal invoked
    

---

## III. Tokens and Compensation

### A. Token Types

- **Time Token (TT)**: Based on time spent in validated activity (e.g., learning, building, reviewing)
    
- **Impact Token (IT)**: Derived from TT, weighted by:
    
    - Influence on others
        
    - Integration into derivatives
        
    - Long-term recall
        
    - Social recognition / peer validation
        

### B. Conversion Flow

```
Time Spent â†’ Time Tokens â†’ Impact Weighted â†’ Impact Tokens â†’ Optional Monetization
```

### C. Distribution Principles

- Livable wage baseline based on average regional needs (DAO-defined, updated quarterly)
    
- Retired impact opt-in â†’ Public Commons transfer (with non-monetary recognition and 1-cycle spotlight)
    
- Reduced weighting for:
    
    - AI-generated content without significant human curation
        
    - Public domain reuse
        

---

## IV. Personal Knowledge Vaults (PKM System)

- Every user has a dynamic, semantic vault
    
- Content, notes, and interpretations stored separately but cross-linked
    
- Time and impact data feed back into vault insights
    
- User-defined collections, stats, and memory-tracking
    

---

## V. Governance (DAO Protocols)

- **Governance Weight**: Based on recent activity and non-monetary reverence
    
- **Council of Wisdom**: Top impact holders, rotating
    
- **Spokespeople**: Revocable, transparent, advisory
    
- **Curators**: Non-paid, oversee cultural sanctum and legacy validation
    
- **Reflection Cycles**: Community responds to introspective prompts every few cycles
    

---

## VI. Monetization & Royalties

- Automated fractional compensation
    
- Project-based royalty model (like music publishing):
    
    - X% to originator
        
    - Y% to remixer
        
    - Z% to contributors
        
- IRL Profit-sharing enabled (e.g., product built on protocol â†’ contributors compensated)
    
- Workers receive impact-based profit share proportionate to effort/time/contribution
    

---

## VII. Exam & Validation System

- Exams used to validate memory retention
    
- Points increase over time if content is remembered across delays
    
- Bonus rewards for accurate citation and application
    
- No punishment for failing, but repeated success encouraged via incentives
    
- Community and AI moderation to prevent farming
    

---

## VIII. Obsolescence & Decay Protocols

- Impact naturally depreciates with age and integration
    
- Creators can maintain private IP only for limited time (then public with compensation)
    
- Upon creator death:
    
    - Unmet needs of kin paid first
        
    - Remainder enters community pool
        
- Guilds and communities absorb inactive treasuries after defined decay cycles
    

---

## IX. Ethical & Legal Safeguards

- No non-competes; lifelong compensation for real impact
    
- All tokens non-investment by default (utility only)
    
- Transparent audits of all payout logic
    
- PKM activity logs anonymized unless opted into traceability
    

---

## X. Next Steps / Build Sequence

1. **Vault Prototype** (track content, time, tagging)
    
2. **Impact Engine** (calculate IT from TT + semantic trace)
    
3. **Token Simulator** (run simulations on DAO reward models)
    
4. **Assessment System** (build recall-based evaluation)
    
5. **Governance MVP** (Snapshot, Tally, or custom DAO)
    
6. **Public Rollout**: testbed network + open source integrations

## XI. Vision Statement

> "Our only truly finite resource is time. Let us track it, honor it, and compensate it â€” not just with currency, but with legacy."

# ðŸ§  Implementation Blueprint V2: The Impact Attribution and Compensation Framework (ARX Protocol)

## I. Core Philosophy

At its foundation, this system redefines compensation around _impact_, _effort_, and _time_. It divorces creation from mere productization and recognizes value in education, art, labor, and ideation. Everyoneâ€™s contribution is tracked and rewarded according to its **verifiable effect on others**. The result is an adaptive and transparent royalty system rooted in digital traceability and semantic feedback.

We abandon speculative tokenomics in favor of direct-impact-driven compensation. **No tradeable currency is required.** Instead, platform subscriptions and grants fund a **knowledge redistribution mechanism**.

---

## II. Fund Distribution Model (Non-Crypto)

### A. Direct Subscription Model

- Platform users subscribe using fiat (or stablecoin) in tiers.
    
- Subscription fees pooled into a **Creator Compensation Reserve (T)**.
    
- No speculative holding. Users receive **time access**, not tokens.
    

### B. Impact-Based Payout Formula

```plaintext
T = Total Creator Pool (monthly)
L = Livable Wage Baseline
Iáµ¢ = User i's Impact Score
Î£I = Sum of All User Impact Scores

Base Compensation:
Cáµ¢ = min(L, T * (Iáµ¢ / Î£I))

If Î£C < T â†’ Surplus S = T - Î£C

Surplus Redistribution:
Ráµ¢ = S * (Iáµ¢ / Î£I)

Final Payout = Cáµ¢ + Ráµ¢
```

---

## III. Impact Score (Iáµ¢) Calculation

A blended, modular weight system governed by DAO consensus:

| Signal              | Description                                                  | Notes         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Recall Tests        | Memory-verified retrieval in exams or quizzes                | High weight   |
| Content Remixes     | Derivative works that reuse original content                 | Medium weight |
| Citations           | Links, references, and quotes (in discussion or content)     | Medium weight |
| Vocabulary Diff     | Topic increase in userâ€™s semantic footprint post-interaction | Medium weight |
| Saves & Interaction | Passive or engaged saving into vaults                        | Low-medium    |
| Propagation         | Verifiable shares, forks, memetic spread                     | Medium-high   |
| Longevity           | Repeated use across time                                     | Medium-low    |

---

## IV. Time as a Metric, Not a Token

### A. Why Time Tokens Were Removed

- Time is **measured**, not minted.
    
- Holding tokens leads to **speculation or hoarding**.
    
- Instead: Time **flows** into creators proportionally during user interaction, but **carries no tradeable value**.
    

### B. New Mechanism

- Userâ€™s **subscription period** determines their contribution capacity (e.g., 1000 min/month).
    
- Time spent with content is **logged** and used to **calculate share of impact** (influences Iáµ¢).
    
- Shorter content with **higher recall** = higher impact per minute.

## V. Creator Tiers and IP Models

|Tier|Description|Rights|Limits|
|---|---|---|---|
|Public Contributor|Shares IP under open license|Eligible for full impact payout|Must allow remix + citation|
|Private Contributor|Keeps IP closed|Reduced impact payout|Cannot receive from remixes|
|Reverent Retired|Opts out of monetization|Public tribute + sanctum archive|Irrevocable (pending review)|

## VI. Platform Infrastructure (Non-Blockchain)

- **Semantic Graphs** for idea lineage tracking
    
- **User Vaults** to log time, content engagement, and interpretation
    
- **Impact Engine** uses recorded metrics to continuously update Iáµ¢
    
- **PKM-based Exams** to validate memory & integration

## VII. Future Considerations for Globalization

- Transparent audit logs of all impact distributions
    
- Optional integration with **stablecoins** or digital wallets **only** for transparency/export purposes
    
- Global Livability Index research for eventual cross-region parity
    
- Potential DAO-controlled treasury and reputation-weighted voting
