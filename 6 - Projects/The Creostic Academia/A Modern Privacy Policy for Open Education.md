# The Private SCOOL
## The ARX Foundation's Privacy-Centric Education Model

### Vision

We envision a decentralized, user-empowered platform for education that rewards creators based on the real-world impact of their contributions — without compromising user privacy. This document outlines a framework for such a system, integrating concepts of impact scoring, retention-based assessment, opt-in data use, and zero-trust architecture.

---

## I. System Overview

- **Users** engage with educational content through a personalized vault stored locally.
- **Creators** are rewarded based on verified impact: how effectively their content spreads, is remembered, and is cited or remixed.
- **The Platform** coordinates metadata hashing, synchronizes impact logs, and distributes compensation transparently.

The user’s learning vault is never centrally stored. Instead, hashes of verified activity are submitted for creator impact calculations.

---

## II. Impact Scoring Framework

Impact is assessed via:

- **Engagement Quality** (not just quantity): how deeply a user interacts with the material.
- **Retention & Recall**: measured through follow-up assessments.
- **Propagation**: when content is cited, adapted, or recommended by other users.

A creator’s compensation is a function of weighted impact across these dimensions. Example weights:

|Dimension|Metric|Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Retention|Recall rate over time|40%|
|Propagation|Cites, remixes, and shares|35%|
|Engagement|Completion rate, time spent, depth|25%|

---

## III. Privacy by Design: Zero-Trust + Opt-In

Instead of assuming user trust by default, we:

- **Store all learning vaults locally** — never on our servers.
- **Use hash-matching** to verify activity without accessing raw data.
- **Retain no identifiable metadata** unless explicitly permitted.

Users may opt-in to:

- Share anonymized data to improve recommendation models.
- License their data for model training in exchange for reduced subscription fees.

We reverse the typical surveillance model: all tracking is visible, user-controlled, and fairly compensated.

---

## IV. Cheating Mitigation & Incentive Alignment

### For Users:

- Cheating harms only themselves unless it distorts impact calculations.
- Spot-checks, retention checks, and randomized quizzes mitigate false engagement.

### For Creators:

- Gaming the system for extra compensation (e.g. fake students) triggers audits.
- **Bug bounty program**: discover vulnerabilities, get rewarded, help us improve.

### System-Level:

- All metadata and hashes are transparently auditable.
- Anomaly detection (e.g. hypergrowth from bots) flags unfair patterns.

---

## V. Vault Deletion & Compensation Integrity

A key concern is what happens when a user deletes their vault:

- **Solution A:** Retain **anonymized impact metadata**, e.g. “User X completed Module Y.” This ensures creators still receive credit.
- **Solution B:** Let creators define **compensation thresholds**: if a user pays a membership or tiered fee, the creator accepts upfront compensation and no further impact tracking.

This is equivalent to Patreon-style tiers for private/ad-free content.

---

## VI. Toward an Offline Mode (Long-Term Roadmap)

An offline-first system is desirable for global access, digital sovereignty, and decentralization. Our phased approach:

### Phase 1: Downloaded Access

- Cache encrypted content modules.
- Hashes sync once reconnected.

### Phase 2: Verified Local Logging

- Local daemons track verified interactions.
- Submit signed hashes post-hoc for impact scoring.

### Phase 3: Fully Offline Instances

- Trusted community nodes run their own sync servers.
- Useful for classrooms, low-bandwidth areas, or high-trust enclaves.

---

## VII. Transparency & Creator Fund Distribution

All creator impact data is logged publicly, anonymized by user, and viewable via a blockchain-inspired audit log:

|Creator|Impact Score|Propagation Events|Retention Avg|Compensation ($)|
|---|---|---|---|---|

We may use a stablecoin or direct fiat payouts, but all distributions are logged.

---

## VIII. Monetization Ethics

We do not sell user data. Ever.

Users may opt in to license anonymized behavioral data for:

- Improving AI models
- Academic research
- Transparency reports

All such licensing is compensated and optional.

---

## IX. Call to Action

If you're a:

- **Creator:** Help us shape the curriculum of the future.
- **Engineer:** Let’s build a privacy-first learning platform.
- **Learner:** Be the test subject for a new way of growing.

Reach out. Fork the repo. Join the movement.

Let’s make education worthy of trust again.

# Zero-Trust Consent Framework for Ethical Metadata Use in Learning Systems

## Abstract

This whitepaper proposes a new architecture for ethical metadata handling in learning systems: the Zero-Trust Consent Framework (ZTCF). ZTCF enables personalized content recommendation, retention tracking, and impact scoring without compromising user privacy. It empowers users with verifiable local control over their data and offers incentives for voluntary participation in system-level optimization and AI training.

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern educational and behavioral systems increasingly rely on metadata to optimize learning outcomes, personalize content, and assess user impact. However, traditional architectures centralize this behavioral metadata, leading to inferred surveillance, privacy violations, and exploitation without user compensation.

We argue that metadata is essential but should not be harvested without user control. Instead, we propose a cryptographic, zero-trust approach that:

- Keeps all identifiable metadata on local devices
    
- Uses server-side hashes for verification only
    
- Requires user permission (or compensation) to access or use metadata
    

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Core Principles

- **Zero-trust**: The system never assumes it should have access to user data
    
- **Privacy by architecture**: All learning metadata resides on user-owned devices
    
- **Proof without visibility**: Server verifies learning outcomes without knowing personal activity
    
- **Optional openness**: Users opt-in to share metadata for AI training in exchange for incentives
    

### 2.2 System Layers

| Layer              | Function                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Vault        | Stores raw behavioral metadata (e.g., time-on-task, clickpaths)        |
| System Proof Store | Stores hashes of metadata or zk-SNARK-style commitments                |
| Consent Broker     | User holds a partial key; full access only possible with user approval |
| Incentive Engine   | Optional compensation for training, recommendation, or research use    |

---

## 3. Metadata Use Cases

### 3.1 Required (Mandatory)

- **Impact verification**: Users must allow hashed proof generation to prevent cheating (e.g., fake completions, vault sales)
    
- **System integrity checks**: Ensures vaults are not tampered with or automated externally
    

### 3.2 Optional (User-Compensated)

- **AI algorithm training**: Users can opt-in to let their metadata improve learning models
    
- **Content recommendation**: Users can allow temporary metadata usage for personalized suggestions
    
- **Public impact reports**: Users may choose to share their anonymized learning contributions
    

---

## 4. Cryptographic Components

### 4.1 Hash-Based Metadata Verification

- Content interaction hashes (e.g., SHA256 summaries of time-click patterns)
    
- Timestamped Merkle chains to prove metadata order and integrity
    
- Prevents replay attacks or retroactive manipulation
    

### 4.2 Shamir's Secret Sharing for Access

- Vault access requires secret split between user and system
    
- Unless both agree, vault data remains unreadable
    
- Enables on-demand, verifiable consent
    

### 4.3 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkPs)

- Users submit proofs of retention or propagation without exposing raw data
    
- Example: "I scored above X on Y topic after Z hours" without showing which content was viewed
    

---

## 5. Incentive Design

|User Action|Reward Mechanism|
|---|---|
|Opting in to metadata training|Discounted subscription or token credit|
|Sharing anonymized learning patterns|Visibility in impact leaderboard|
|Contributing to public recommendation AI|Governance tokens or priority ranking|

The incentive system is designed to be **transparent, auditable**, and **optional**.

---

## 6. Implementation Guidance

- All metadata capture libraries must be open-source
    
- Clients should be able to fully export and delete vaults
    
- Consent mechanisms must be legible and revocable
    
- Periodic audits can verify that the system never collected unauthorized data
    
- A fallback offline mode should exist where no server access is required
    

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Zero-Trust Consent Framework provides a path forward for privacy-respecting educational and behavioral systems. It embraces the functional necessity of metadata while rejecting surveillance capitalism. By combining local-first data ownership, cryptographic verification, and voluntary economic participation, ZTCF can help create a new class of learning platforms that are both ethically grounded and operationally powerful.
