Activity hub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform

Content creation and distribution platforms :: Youtube (google) / insta (meta) / X / patreon idgaf  - creators that utilize youtube (any platform for that matter) can and should be able to opt to share their content on our platform as well; request their integration with activity hub and if rejected target the creators themselves; the mentality that one cannot do this is just a mental block lmao, we have the ability to contact anyone and everyone on this planet with a few clicks of a button and that is here to stay so fuck it lets use it for good.
	I would love to partner with google and youtube, make a strictly educational platform s.t. their market share for entertainment isnt hit too bad (my childhood was based on youtube to be frank, I am of the youtube generation) and I owe them a lot of my inspiration but it'll be over my dead body (or dead career) that this is acquired by them; google is a graveyard for sick ideas (yes they do cool shit but its a strictly profit centric model... I have beef for them shutting down the modular phone and shutting down fitbit sdk on my watch model, like at lease open source it!!!)

Content creators themselves :: I really want to reach out to all of my favorite musicians and designers to ask for help / to use their music / designs in marketing this (from the people for the people as is the true American ideology ~ from the creators for the creators) 

Knowledge platforms :: Khan Academy / udemy / individual education content creators
	Incentivize with novel compensation platform (and don't limit them to our platform!!!)
		Little to no risk unless the platforms try to clap back and cut their monetization but if they do that they are greedy fucks that deserve to lose their community.
	My list is down below

The Government :: The Department of Education // DOGE - I just applied for DOGE this morning but if they are already trying to reform the education system lets save them the time and effort lmao (and save the time and effort that went into creating the DOE in the first place; if just shut down thats such a waste IMO)

Content creation tools
	Give creators an edge!
		Figma
		Adobe

LLM tools:
	OpenAI, ollama (meta), grok (X), claude, perplexity, you name it (too many these days);
	Offer to have them all integrated and the user gets to pick (compensate the AI companies accordingly but like fuck it why not???)
		Train a model to switch between models per task agentic style if need be

Education institutions:
	Yes this may "make them obsolete" but it doesnt have to end their existance altogether at all!?!?
	The business side of things is great; they as institutions are great; I just disagree of the conflation of finances and learning in the way that it currently is.
	Additionally the communities built are priceless; the Socratic method only works when interlocutors interact and collaborate towards the fundamental pursuit of knowledge.
		Sadly the overhead of in-person activities is hard to reduce; the in-person schooling may become a luxery; but thats just a problem we need to try to solve later on down the line. As of now if we can reduce the clutter of course managment and certification I think that will make an immense dent in the cost of in-person education anyways; so fuck it we ball.
	Offer our tool as a backend to them to use to help their students prosper; as a tool to connect students with their ideal pursuits.

Personal favorites:
Are.na - board view integration;; art content etc
Github - request hosting assistance whilst we get things set up; 
Uploadthing // Theo - t3.gg - love his content and think he'd be down to help out with hosting if github falls through
Leanstack - creation pipeline that can be integrated
Obsidian - personal knowledge managment system (free!) with amazing community; def think they'd be down for it to be integrated if it isn't charged for.
	If not can just prompt users to go get it themselves and just use it...
	Direct the user to define a folder to call home to their second brain and build our own stuff.
	Local-hosting personal information is an imperative to true security (ofc backup and sync but can use github / offer our own backups if they want to share their data with us; its an issue of trust).
