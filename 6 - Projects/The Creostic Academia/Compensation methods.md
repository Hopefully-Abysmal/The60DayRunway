Akin to DOI, ContentID, SSID, and the basic URL, everything and everyone needs to be given an identifier for traceability of impact attribution and compensation (idea for platform: [[ARX CDN]]). To transition to the [[ crypto as backend]] idea make wallets for each entity (be it a research paper, audio, video, image, NFT, whatever the fuck kind of digital good you want to apply this to) and identify the person(s) in charge of the project to task with distributing the funds (to be decided retroactively by those identified as project leads; will be communicating with the individual workers and unions surrounding the worker though such that exploitation does not continue; make sure they know their rights and leverage). Default to even split if nothing is taken within X amount of time. (Yes if they never pull these funds itll be a waste of time and energy but thats the beauty of crypto, if they dont convert the funds to their native currency the value of the cryptocurrency does not depreciate, although is held up; if they do pull the funds the funds go back to the platform / another user of the platform and there are three economic outcomes for that worker: they spend it on the platform, spend it off the platform, or save it TO SPEND LATER. In this day and age consumption is a safe bet lmao, just a matter of time. Regardless the economy is stimulated, the platform grows, and the mission is achieved.)
