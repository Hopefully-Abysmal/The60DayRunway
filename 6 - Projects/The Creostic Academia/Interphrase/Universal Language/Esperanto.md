Fuck I love Wikipedia

I have a really strong desire to utilize [[Interphrase]] to push the development and learning of a universal language (remember the goal of all of this is world peace lmao)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto
As a romance language speaker (English and Spanish) Esperanto seems to be my first choice, yes it excludes the non-romance languages in intuitivity, but it is designed to be easy to learn regardless. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantology
Curious how science would progress under this language rather than just english, can we solve jargon while we're at it? Translating into "Simple" Esperanto or "Simple" English

Need an LLM in Esperanto; shouldn't be too hard to make.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_phonology
Once Text to speech and speech to text have been perfected for english // or other romance languages // we can move to pushing this as an application (if it makes things any easier)

Why I DON'T Like Esperanto - Language Simp 
- "Esperanto is too eurocentric"
	- Yeah I do see that being a problem lmao
- "Racist Language"
	- BRUH
- "Too many root words"
	- Toki-pona -> 140 root words
- "Poisoning the minds of the youth"
	- Easy to learn is a noble pursuit, but too easy = too easy to choose over anything better
- "At that point just learn American"
	- I mean thatd be too easy // a cop-out. English is eh
