I love how duckduckgo shows a calculator when I type a calculation; wish I didnt have to see the extra shit though;; just have it minimized so I can ignore the irrelevant results
	On their server side too: dont have to pull all of the resources / websited just for a simple calculator loockup;; let the user dictate that they want it from a specific website or a collection of websites to browse through UX

Similarly for definitions (love a good dictionary), dont need all of the resources unless I ask for them. Also the AI call was unnecessary, why waste the power to do that?
	One why could be verification of the information, but like its a fucking word that is already being pulled from a reputable source...
	Do the processing for verification once and cache it (or multiple times for security and to avoid hallucination / bias)
