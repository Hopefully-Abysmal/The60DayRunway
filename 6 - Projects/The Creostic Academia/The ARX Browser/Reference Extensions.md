Only thing is there's no way to see what it was prior to censorship nor any way to know it was censored;; need to italicize / highlight background or something and allow for hover to show original wording

^ Functionality for hover already present within the stats tab, just need to apply throughout utilization

Clean up the plugin, allow a bot to set these terms dynamically (automatic word-list selection) and boom you have BII.

Attempted to use the audio muting and it works but it needs some more development (relies directly on transcript timing so is only as good as the transcription timing); direct integration with the site would be required for seamless playback;; essentially vid-angel on steroids. ALSO text on screen is not censored nor imagery, multi-modal could be quite interesting.
