> _Serendipity engine ‚Äî what you didn't know you needed._

- Think: randomized trails, philosophical sparks, mystery boxes
    
- Feels like: being found by ideas, not just finding them

Thinking I want this to be multi-modal, have a chat component to discuss what is being seen / heard / experienced and dive deeper. Think of this as a go-to to start a deep dive on something that may be of interest but one has little to no previous exposure on.

# GPT

I‚Äôve kept the **scaffolded layout** while weaving in the conversational dynamics, mood shaping, and multimodal intelligence you liked.
