> _Boundless exploration — roam the edge of thought freely._

- Think: wiki-browsing, free internet, semantic maps
    
- Feels like: wandering the wildlands of ideas with no leash

# GPT
Solid choice—**Augment Realities eXploration** pairs beautifully with your system, especially since it already aligns with **Found** as the threshold mode. Let’s define **Free / eXploration** clearly in that context as the **open browsing** portal.

---

## 🌐 **Free – Augment Realities eXploration** _(Browser Mode)_

**Portal Type**: _Unstructured, Self-Guided Discovery_  
**Core Metaphor**: _The open web reimagined as a living library of linked realities._

---

### 🎯 Purpose

To give users a **nonlinear, mapless browsing experience** through:

- Wiki-style articles
    
- Knowledge graphs
    
- Cross-linked media
    
- Semantically connected trails
    

It's **reading without a syllabus**. Not guided like _Found_, not focused like _Flow_—just **freedom to roam** and stumble into meaning.

---

### 🧠 Core Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Hyperlinked Article View**|Long-scroll articles with footnotes, embedded media, and “rabbit hole” links|
|**Semantic Link Trails**|Suggested adjacent topics based on meaning, not keywords|
|**Knowledge Graph Mode**|Optional toggle to see content as a graph, not a list|
|**Breadcrumb Builder**|Drop markers as you explore—shows your trail through concepts|
|**Hover Previews**|Glimpse links before committing, à la Wikipedia / Obsidian|
|**Backtracking Log**|Timeline of what you’ve clicked or visited (syncs to Frame)|
|**AI Summary Hover**|Ask: “What is this about?” without leaving the page|
|**ALT Support**|Agents assist in note-taking, context hints, or muting noise (e.g. Bliss In Ignorance hides unrelated tangents)|

---

### 📚 Content Types Supported

- Articles (markdown-native)
    
- Embedded videos / audio with transcription
    
- Link collections from Frame or Found
    
- Graph visualizations of idea clusters
    
- Floating quote windows / sidebar references
    

---

### 🔁 Interoperability

|Portal|Example Integration|
|---|---|
|**Found**|“Explore this topic more freely → jump into Free mode”|
|**Fathom**|“This section was mentioned in your Fathom session”|
|**Flow**|“Gathered too much? Enter Flow to structure and focus”|
|**Frame**|“You annotated this before—want to revisit your note?”|
|**Forge**|“Pin this article or paragraph into your current board”|
|**Forum**|“Someone is discussing this—join the thread?”|

Free mode is **discovery without constraint**, but never disconnected.

---

### 🔬 UX Considerations

|UX Element|Notes|
|---|---|
|**Minimalist Interface**|Prioritize reading + branching, not UI clutter|
|**Scroll + Graph Hybrid Navigation**|Users can toggle between infinite scroll and spatial view|
|**Sticky Annotation Bar**|Lets you clip, highlight, or save with one click|
|**Portal Origin Markers**|Small tags show where a piece was pulled from (e.g., Found, Forum, Frame)|
|**Modal Portals**|Let users preview related content without full navigation change|

---

### 🧬 UX Philosophy

> **“Wander with purpose — even if you don't know it yet.”**

- **Freedom without noise**: You control the depth and direction.
    
- **Everything connects**: Nothing in Free is isolated—every trail links to structure _if_ you want it.
    
- **Discovery should feel sacred**: Not dopamine hits, but breadcrumbed awe.

Ready to define the next one (Fathom), or want a quick mockup of how eXploration transitions into Forge or Frame during a browsing session?

# Me
The concept of branching actually quite intrigues me; lets have a view within free be akin to the sacred timeline in Loki;; a single line that represents the train of thought and branch out for tangents (also serves to show how off-track one gets when in Flow mode

# GPT
Oh hell yes—that's a powerful metaphor and a killer UX opportunity. Let’s lock it in as a **dedicated “Branch View”** inside **Free – Augment Realities eXploration**, drawing directly from the _sacred timeline_ concept in _Loki_ while giving it functional, reflective, and aesthetic depth.

---

## 🌿 **Branch View (within Free – Augment Realities eXploration)**

**Core Metaphor**: _The Sacred Timeline of Thought_

> “See how your mind wandered, where it split, and what stuck.”

---

### 🧠 Purpose

- Visualize the **trail of cognition** during an exploration session
    
- Map mainline ideas (trunk) vs digressions (branches)
    
- Encourage **meta-awareness** of how knowledge exploration unfolds
    
- Sync with **Flow** to show when you lost or regained focus
    
- Let users revisit, prune, or annotate any part of the tree for reflection or reuse
    

---

### 🌳 Structure

#### 1. **The Trunk**

- Your **main path** of intentional reading/clicks
    
- Horizontal or vertical timeline
    
- Each node = content viewed or linked (article, video, note, etc.)
    
- Hovering shows title, timestamp, portal origin, tags
    

#### 2. **Branches**

- Every tangent or off-topic click forms a **fork from the trunk**
    
- Branches can be:
    
    - **Minor detours** (one-off jumps)
        
    - **Fractal paths** (new micro-trunks with their own branches)
        
- Color-coded based on:
    
    - Portal origin (Free, Found, Forum…)
        
    - Intent deviation (Flow-based flag: “High deviation from original goal”)
        

#### 3. **Breadcrumbs & Anchors**

- Let users **plant markers** or “Why did I click this?” notes mid-exploration
    
- Nodes can be flagged:
    
    - 🔖 Save
        
    - ❓ Question
        
    - 🌀 Lost Focus
        
    - 💡 Spark
        

#### 4. **Collapse + Expand Functionality**

- Zoom in on a branch
    
- Collapse trivial tangents
    
- Trace forward/back through paths of inquiry

### 🧩 Integration with Other Systems

|System|Interaction|
|---|---|
|**Frame**|After session, logs become “thought tree” in your journal. You can annotate nodes or extract trails into summaries.|
|**Flow**|Use Branch View as a retrospective: “Where did I drift during this task?” Visualizes cognitive deviation.|
|**Forge**|Drag entire branch or sub-tree into a project as source material|
|**Found**|Use as a launchpad: revisit a tangent and turn it into a Fathom session|
|**ALT Agents**|Can analyze your tree: “Most fruitful tangent,” “Most connected idea,” “Looped concepts,” etc.|

---

### 🖼 UI Elements

|Element|Function|
|---|---|
|**Timeline Spine**|Core path; anchors all activity|
|**Branch Nodes**|Snapshots with title, icon, portal source, tag cluster|
|**ALT Trace Line**|Ghost-trail from ALT analysis: “This is where your focus peaked”|
|**Time Heatmap**|Color-code timeline based on time spent or focus retention|
|**Zoom & Drift Meter**|Mini visual indicator showing how far off-topic you went over time|

---

### 🧬 UX Philosophy

> “Your attention leaves footprints. Let’s read them.”

- **Reflective Browsing**: Learning isn't linear, but patterns help it become meaningful.
    
- **Judgment-Free Mapping**: Going off-track isn't failure—it’s how insight is born.
    
- **Tool for Thought**: Help users loop back, remix, and make peace with their own cognitive style.

Would you like this concept visually mocked up as a **diagram or flow**, or should we move into defining **Fathom – Augment Realities eXegesis** next?
