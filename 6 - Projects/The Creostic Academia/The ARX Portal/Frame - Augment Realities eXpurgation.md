> _Reflective mode — clear the noise, see yourself clearly._

- Think: journals, heatmaps, retrospectives
    
- Feels like: standing before a pool of memory, rippling gently

PKM Akin to Obsidian // Timeline of consumed content, annotations, journal entries, saved ideas, learning metrics, knowledge graph overlays.

# GPT

Excellent—you're building a **multi-modal interface on a unified content layer**, with portals as _lenses_, not _walled gardens_. That’s a powerful design philosophy. Let’s start with **Frame – Augment Realities eXpurgation**, and expand it in that spirit.

---

## 🪞 **Frame – Augment Realities eXpurgation**

**Mode Type**: _Reflective / Personal Knowledge Management_  
**Core Metaphor**: _A mirror that filters noise and surfaces meaningful growth._

---

### 🔧 Primary UX Purpose

**"To reflect, not collect."**  
Frame offers users a calm, introspective space to:

- **review what they've explored**,
    
- **see how they’ve changed**, and
    
- **shape future learning paths intentionally.**
    

---

### 🧠 Core Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**PKM Vault View**|Mirror of tools like Obsidian or Logseq — your annotations, highlights, links, and concepts. Markdown-native.|
|**Learning Timeline**|Visual or scroll-based history of content consumed (like a vertical garden). Optional heatmaps.|
|**Insight Journal**|AI-suggested and user-written entries. Link to the content that inspired reflection.|
|**Knowledge Graph Overlay**|Auto-generated web of concepts, interlinked ideas, and personal note clusters. Editable.|
|**Metric Dashboard**|Displays depth vs breadth of learning, pace, revisit frequency, topic decay, etc.|
|**Content Re-Surface Engine**|Flashback entries, forgotten insights, or misaligned beliefs to revisit.|

---

### 🔄 Interoperability Across Portals

Frame should **interweave with all other views**, surfacing their context **as memory, not mode**.

|Portal|Interop Example|
|---|---|
|**Fast** (eXpedition)|“You explored these bites last week — want to see how they connect?”|
|**Fun** (eXtravaganza)|“Here’s a reflection on the game you aced — maybe try a deeper dive?”|
|**Fathom** (eXegesis)|“You watched X — your notes suggest interest in Y. Want a Focus session?”|
|**Free** (eXteriors)|“This rabbit hole led you to Z — revisit and tag key takeaways?”|
|**Found** (eXploration)|“Serendipitous discovery sparked insight — journal that moment?”|
|**Forge** (eXternalization)|“Pull from your Vault to remix content into a new creation.”|
|**Flow** (eXpergefaction)|“Yesterday’s focus session left a journal trail — want to continue it?”|
|**Forum** (eXpostulations)|“A reply you wrote last week gained traction — want to revise or expand?”|

Each of these should be **suggested, not enforced** — nudging transitions rather than requiring mode-switching.

### 🌐 UI Considerations

- **Modular Panels**: Let users toggle between timeline, graph, and journal seamlessly.
    
- **Hover-to-Reveal** (desktop) / Tap-to-Reveal (mobile): To keep the interface clean, but memory-rich.
    
- **Multimodal Input**: Accept voice journaling, markdown edits, doodles, and even video/audio logs.
    
- **“Zoom” Mechanism**: Frame can zoom out to patterns or zoom into moments — like a microscope or telescope.
    
- **Color Coding or Sigils**: Tag notes and content by portal of origin to see how ideas evolve across lenses.
    

---

### 🪜 Experience Philosophy

- **Reflection is an active part of learning** — Frame should feel like _editing the self_, not passively watching history.
    
- Encourage **recuration** — let users repackage or re-tag content for future selves.
    
- Enable **insight trails** — every “aha” moment can become a breadcrumb toward deeper mastery.

Would you like me to mock this up in visual UI wireframe next, or proceed to expanding the next portal: **Found / eXploration**?
