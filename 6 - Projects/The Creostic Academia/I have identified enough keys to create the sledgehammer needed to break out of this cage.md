# The platform from my mind to paper (screen):
Activity-pub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform
Blockchain smart contracts - traceable, transparent, and soon to be accepted method of attributing impact to creators and rightfully compensating them.
	Solves AI content training problem too so added bonus lmao
	I propose as a peace offering to the current platforms that we offer this open source; allow them to use it, may the best platform and community win the user's time!
Algorithms based on SEO and the social media doomscrolling machine
	We want education to be addicting! To be entertaining!
	We all WANT to help the human race, we as humans just crave the drug that is dopamine and have found it in short form content.
		So lets give the people what they want, short form content if they so choose but modular content served with PURPOSE.
Proprietary aptitude model / algorithm
	Think DND stats; we all want strength 20 (100 if talking bloodborne / fromsoft shit)
	Apply that model across all disciplines; let the user rack up points for each discipline as they interact with the platform (consumption, creation, documentation, interpersonal interaction, etc.) and get certified at various milestones along mastery pathways
		Current education system does this but super inefficiently
		Those who want to pivot should be able to; otherwise they wont find their fit in society and will not be fulfilled by their work (my goal is to enable this fulfillment)
	Keep a log of this all and build business end to allow one to utilize everything they have consumed as their resume; I am a firm believer in the mindset that we are what we consume,, akin to the mindset of you are who you surround yourself with but in the age of the internet we are surrounded on all fronts so dont really get to choose what influences you.
Focus centered interface
	Lockdown browser type shit // like logging into a VM
	Find ways to ultra-refine the content people consume for their betterment; with full consent however.
	The concept of user-defined censorship is my prerogative; think reddit / discord spoilers, you can always interact with irrelevant content but only if you choose to do so (as it is a distraction one could potentially negatively reinforce this but I dont really like that)
