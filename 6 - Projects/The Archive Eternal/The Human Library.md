Archivist movements like the wayback machine and internet archive are very inspiring to me; I've had this idea for a while now but didn't think it to be really feasible (sitting on my own hands). I quite enjoy the concept of a human library, where you can rent someones time (buy them lunch / a coffee) and just have a chat with them!! Not necessarily feasible due to the constraints of there only being one of that person, though could still be a cool thing for living people.

>TLDR: Check out a human like one would a book
	Buy lunch and have a conversation!!
	Meet new people and build your network.
	Get off social media and be in real life together.

Similarly, the concept of being able to converse with people from the past is SOOOOO interesting for me. Now out of any time in our history we have the tools to do so (pseudo-conversationalist) via LLM and the archival of ones notes, words, and in a sense their essence and personality.

[[Steve jobs]] had a similar desire, to speak with aristotle. I want to make that a reality. On the same vein, I think through his notes Jobs could be the first candidate for something like this, essentially akin to a GPT of him (as I'm sure someone has already made) but training specifically on all of his data.

Taking it further, I feel the need to catalogue and honor every human life.

Everyone has a story, everyone can be learned from, so lets do it!! Not everyone needs to be famous or rich enough to have a biography made for them.

See [[DataBANK - Data Immortalization Service|Data Immortalization]] for how to fesibly do this.
