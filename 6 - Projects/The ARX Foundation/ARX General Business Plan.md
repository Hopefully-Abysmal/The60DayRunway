GPT Lean Canvas:

```
Here's your **Lean Canvas** for **The 60 Day Runway / The ARX Foundation**, synthesized from your incredibly detailed and inspiring vision:

---

## 🧭 **Lean Canvas: The 60 Day Runway / The ARX Foundation**

### 1. **Problem**

- Education is expensive, outdated, and gatekept by institutional paywalls and administrative bloat.
    
- Student debt traps creators in survival loops, preventing long-term intellectual and financial freedom.
    
- Content creators and knowledge workers are undercompensated despite their impact.
    
- AI tools are underleveraged in democratizing education.
    
- Hoarding of IP and slow innovation cycles by institutions stifle progress.
    

### 2. **Customer Segments**

- Aspiring learners globally (especially underserved and low-income)
    
- Content creators, educators, and researchers
    
- Students trapped in debt
    
- Altruistic investors and grant-makers
    
- Institutions seeking decentralized education tools
    
- Policy reformers and educational non-profits
    

### 3. **Unique Value Proposition**

> _“A creative survival platform to escape student debt, decentralize knowledge, and empower intellectual self-determination through transparent, open-source collaboration.”_

- Escape loops, own your impact, share your climb — openly.
    
- Not just another education platform: a **DAO-powered revolution** of learning and compensation.
    

### 4. **Solution**

- **The 60 Day Runway**: A public challenge proving the viability of self-sustaining, creator-owned education.
    
- **ARX Academy**: An open-source, contributor-compensating educational operating system.
    
- **Time-based tokens** and blockchain for traceable impact and fair compensation.
    
- **Gamified microlearning journeys**, livestreams, community logs, and Zettelkasten-based curriculum.
    
- Optional AI agents to suggest learning paths and boost personalized growth.
    

### 5. **Channels**

- YouTube (educational & advocacy content)
    
- TikTok (short-form “knowledge quests”)
    
- Patreon & GitHub Sponsors
    
- Academic networks & Discord/Matrix/IRC community integration
    
- Outreach to government (e.g. DOGE), educational orgs, and content creators
    
- Partnerships with Khan Academy, Wikipedia, Obsidian, Are.na, etc.
    

### 6. **Revenue Streams**

- **Freemium SaaS**: Core knowledge is free, tools are premium (e.g., mind-mapping, curriculum builders).
    
- **Collective Sponsorships**: Transparent, opt-in content recommendation engine for mission-aligned brands.
    
- **Institutional Licenses**: Universities, public schools, and incubators pay for backend infrastructure and analytics.
    
- **Token Economy**: Time-based impact tokens with DAO-governed faucets and sinks.
    
- **Grants & Philanthropy**: Public-good funding from education and climate-forward orgs.
    

### 7. **Cost Structure**

- Server infrastructure & carbon offsets (AI, content hosting)
    
- Compensation for contributors, moderators, and developers
    
- DAO tooling & auditing
    
- Community support & moderation
    
- Legal (IP enforcement & license protection)
    

### 8. **Key Metrics**

- Number of students onboarded and debt reduced
    
- Number of contributors fairly compensated via time-tracked equity
    
- Number of educational modules completed and forked
    
- Rate of idea reuse and open innovation
    
- Engagement time vs. burnout vs. real-life impact
    
- DAO governance participation levels
    

### 9. **Unfair Advantage**

- **Founder’s lived experience and transparency**—not a pitch deck, but a life.
    
- Radical openness and meme-worthy documentation attract aligned talent.
    
- Cultural leverage: bridges idealism with practical escape plans.
    
- Pre-built network of creators, thinkers, and underdogs willing to build the future they want to live in.
    
- Deep integration with decentralized tech and proven community-driven platforms.

The 60 Day Runway // The Beginnings of The Arx Foundation

![Pasted image 20250417105237.png](https://github.com/Hopefully-Abysmal/The60DayRunway/blob/main/0%20-%20Housekeeping%2F_Attatchments%2FPasted%20image%2020250417105237.png)
_The Beginnings of The Arx Foundation_

Note: By continuing your perusal of this vault you are bound to the terms of the license and [memorandum of understanding](https://github.com/Hopefully-Abysmal/The60DayRunway/blob/main/0%20-%20Housekeeping%2FMemorandum%20of%20Understanding.md) IP terms listed; this is for the greater good, do not get in our way.

### What Is This?

**The 60 Day Runway** is a public 2-month challenge to escape student debt, secure housing, and build a sustainable, creator-owned life — all before June 30, 2025. It's a test of self-rescue, autonomy, and creative momentum.

This isn’t just a hustle. It’s the **origin story of The Arx Foundation** — a long-term effort to build tools, ideas, and support structures for people stuck in survival loops. The goal is to challenge the myth of merit, reveal the hidden architecture of economic traps, and share everything I learn in the open.

### The Mission

Revolutionize // reform the education system as we know it. We are in a time of misinformation, fear, and turmoil; now is better than any other time to make a change so thats what we are doing.

Specifically: "Make Academia Great Again" by processing and centralizing knowledge on a publically owned platorm with the aim of decentralizing the tools to access and utilize it. The end goal is to create a marketplace of intellectual acceleration methods and strategies; we believe that people can think for themselves and want to ensure that is a secure statement.

### Why?

Generational Motivations:
	Because we have been trained to think we can't.
	- Can't own
	- Can't escape
	- Can't think for ourselves
	- Can't make the world a better place???

General Team Motivations:
	Because we can.

Landon's Motivations:
	Because I graduated with honors and still can't afford rent.  
	Because my wife deserves a degree without our lives collapsing.  
	Because I want to build something that helps others do the same.

** insert your motivations if you help out! **

We believe in making it visible — in **livestreaming** the climb, the mistakes, the breakthroughs, and the burnout; the current market lacks transparency. Open source doesn't mean just community driven; it means complete transparency in all aspects; complete accountability for the power the entity gains.

- Looking for grants, community backers, or people who want to co-build something different
- Attention. Share this with your friends, family, colleagues, anyone who will listen; we are a democratic society and the only way change occurs is with volume of opinion.

### Long-Term Vision: The Arx Foundation

> "What if the systems we need already exist — they just haven't been connected yet for some reason?"

**The Augment Realities Experience (Arx) Foundation** is the name I’m giving to this larger dream — a network of open tools, ideas, stories, and support systems to help people survive long enough to create. It starts with me, but it won’t end with me.

# [[Academic - Prof Dan Ball]]
"If you dont have access you dont have access"
	WIFI and hardware, but also access to opportunity

tech (social media as tool for garnering attention, communicating through the tools already in place)
	I dont think its a hardware problem anymore; almost everyone has phones (he stated even in Afghanistan!) and if they dont I envy them to an extent lmao
	It was mentioned that its just the hardware does not necessarily grant the insight to utilize them for productivity.

elementary school on up not just higher education

# [[Economist - Brady Talley]]

Look into blitz scaling

Apparently it is the perfect antithesis to what I want to make.

Example: Spotify

Yapped about my ideal setup; next steps, and the concept of individual ownership of IMPACT, not the companies. Companies as entities can still be utilized, shareholders can be left intact; but the people that make the business happen must be aptly compensated for their long term impact in order to allow them to retire. Afterthoughts:
	We make shit up like social security to compensate for the lack of systems like this
	We pay taxes to pay for those who can no longer work because they couldn't create the passive income we all so crave.
	We all need to put in the time and effort to get to the point of security, but that security must be secure in its attainability!! 
	In this current job market security is not a secure assumption; if you get fired or your reputation gets tanked sucks to suck! Guess you have to live out the rest of your life striving to get what you once had!? Go work a dead end job, lie down and take shit for the rest of your life? I'd argue that that blow can be softened! The stakes do not need to be this high!?!?
	By tracing and extending the compensation along that of the lifetime of one's impact; it prioritizes impact over just paying the bills at that moment. The paycheck to paycheck mentality is fixed at the systemic level.

# [[Patents]]
- im of the belief that the concept and utilization in industry of innovation by acquisition and inorganic innovation (that being puzzle piecing old tech together to make new shit) Is going to be in my favor for this one. Apparently they had a lengthy battle for their streaming side of things, so I would be protected on that front (they put in the money to break that precedent for me!)

# # [[Blockchain - Smart Contracts]]

- Great dive into how the current entertainment industry works; explains how the distribution of impact could work
- assumes the viewer is going to want to buy the content out of their own wallets; I think a collective fund approach is a much better alternative.
	- People dont want to pay for content (why pay for something you can't own if you can help it!); they will likely pay for features to optimize the consumption of the content however
	- I'm all for private ownership of goods, but content one watches once then moves on is something one likely won't care if they own...
		- unless you can sell something you don't truly own it.


# [[Finances of Competition]]

https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-education?fy=2024
- we were spending $241.66 BILLION on educational funding in 2024

https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/
- Acquired for 1.65 billion in 2006; doubt its yearly operating expenses are even that much
- basically a glorified cloudflare wrapper tbh
- YouTube Key Statistics
```
    YouTube generated $36.1 billion revenue in 2024, a 14.6% increase year-on-year
    2.74 billion people access YouTube once a month
    YouTube’s most subscribed channel is T-Series, however Mr. Beast earned the most revenue in 2024
    YouTube Premium reached 100 million subscribers in 2024
    YouTube made $14.5 billion from subscriptions in 2024
    YouTube Shorts were watched 70 billion times a day on average in 2024
```
Fucking insane right? But genuinely, one can learn all they learn in school on youtube...

We can still save the department of education, it just needs a radical makeover with the needs and tools of the modern day in mind.

# [[2025-04-15 (handwritten notes)]]
Idea for initial monetization:
		- Freemium model is dope (like are.na)
		- Info and knowledge are free reign for all platforms to use
		- what is differentiating and can be competed on is the tools to accelerate this therefore they can morally be charged for.
			- Attribution of prior work to sources = diversion of funds to that; the only true overhead but it becomes negligible at scale as there is only so much time; only so much learning can occur therefore only so much money can be spent / earned over a finite span of time.
	- Work with any AI of your choosing; integrate into api's to fetch user queries and reflect on them; akin to how social media algorithms track actions.
		- try to predict what the user may be interested in learning next and direct them towards that!
		- use algorithms for knowledge not capital
			- algo for entertainment = lazy generation
			- algo for education = intellectual generation
		- Aim to stimulate X neuropathway; dont cause dopamine crashes like social media lmao.
			- How can this be done safely? 
			- How can this be done to promote organic growth and exploration?
				- Remove the scarcity mindset and replace with the creator (hustle is bleh) mindset
	- A knowledgeable (educated) society is an advanced (advancing) society

- Make learning fun / whimsical / a journey one _wants_ to pursue; not just something someone HAS to pursue to survive (what it seems to be now; the uneducated are not truly living IMO; need to save em).
		- Education is dope AF and really will help the human race make so much progress if done at the scale and efficiency I believe it can be done.
	- Retort on the scaling concept adam brought up last night:
		- SAAS is MAD easy to scale; just gotta buy some servers and pay for the power -- need education to find solution to energy problem -- especially if people and the network build the product!
			- Thats why reddit, stack overflow, youtube, all these social medias for whatever specific thing are popping off. Stack overflow is an edge case though; sadly the non-coding side is falling off; need AI integration. Might reach out and see if can integrate them.
			- Their value proposition is the community they contain; if that community is free to leave however what then? Competition ensues (for even more progress).
				- For my pursuit, it will be a baseline for a new battle; the battle of wits and ability to catch the general population up to the level of higher education with ease.
				- "micro-learning" is a concept that intrigues me. Bite sized education; facts and shit lmao.
					- Find a way to make that entertaining.
			- Linkedin and linkedin learning are on the right track as well, but they need to make it more of a career accelerative thing than just a network thing; for a collective gain. 
			- Wikipedia with more community engagement would go so hard
				- Can hit them up and ask to fetch their content if they are compensated through the structure!!!
					- Also would help offload traffic if users go off site (thinking money moves lmao)
				- Donated to them a while back; want to keep them afloat as they are my ideal company lmao (they need a tech makeover though; zettelkastens for dayzzz)
			- Hostile takeover of all social media:
				- Post EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE.
				- Discord // matrix // IRC integration in Pine64 dev server as example
				- Integrate with activity-hub; I fw it heavy cause it tells monopolies to fuck off
	- Symptoms of an individualist economy include but are not limited to:
		- [[homelessness]]
		- Debt (without the intent of leveraging it)
		- Crime
		- Gatekeeping information


# [[2025-04-16 (dane weinig conversation)]]

VALID DATA
	Filtering between old and new information; valid research methods etc.

AI
	Lacks warmth and community
		Publically fund the above
	Expensive (energy, noise pollution)
		Throw into space lmao

Federalized systems
	Finland is his fav

Child education with AI is bad connotation; focus on human intervention layer and note the subtleties that allow the child to prosper in their desired path.
	AI aptitude testing throughout education.

Jose wanted me to look into singapore for meritocratic society

Innovator != creator -> make it a creator pump.
	Creation != productization; anything that can make an impact is a worthy creation
		i.e. art, media, writing, lower-level non-automatable labour (all still have an impact and move society forward thus are noble pursuits we should encourage if the student is a good fit for it.)

It was mentioned that the long term may pose a new issue; how can this be funded // generate money after innovation has reached its conclusion?
	Context: the concept of the model being a source of competition for who can create the best AI // algorithmic // whatever tools to increase the utility of this system grinding to a halt as a result of monopolization / a dominant party than one cannot top. 
	I find the assumptions behind the question appalling (that innovation can ever truly cease) but will entertain it for the sake of the argument.
	I believe at that point it would become a contest of rates; the rate of funding vs the rate of innovation. If it becomes un-sustainable to fund the innovation private businesses will step in to continue funding akin to how it is now;; the concept of signing away your time later for short term gratification.
	However, I think that the nature of this toolset // system would prevent such a thing from being a bad thing; if the models are open for all to use one can just use that dominant model to assist in the endeavor of creating the next best thing. Thats really what I'm doing right now! ChatGPT and the other LLM players are revolutionizing the way information is delivered to the masses; they are those key players in the thought experiment, though that isn't stopping me rather enabling me to create something at this scale; giving me faith we can keep up with the acceleration (albeit requiring significant effort and alignment within goals). 

I am trying to provide light to the world; I want to be an optimist because if I'm not then who will be? My goals may be lofty, but I genuinely think they are realizable with the assistance of everyone impacted by what we will create!

This can be a community effort, we don't have to sit back and wait for someone to save us; in fact we cannot. 


# [[2025-04-16 (handwritten notes)]]

Context: ideating on concept of the [[Memorandum of Understanding]] and gamification of incubators and the reformation of the education system
	- "needs" - take the evaluation structure from FAFSA; they know how to keep you on your bottom line income when in need for real
		- obv tweak as needed and add some actually good customer service // serve yourself center lmao
		- Def need to back up FAFSA if theyre going to take down the DOE; it has some good // redeeming qualities (calculators // resources etc.)
	- Akin to [[GTFO Housing]] meet the needs then kick out once done
		- at that point they can self sustain; babying becomes a limitation in and of itself after a certain point
		- Limits are amazing for creativity; but I think inciting // allowing suffering is taking it too far.
		- What differentiates from the current system:
			- Teach but have mercy.
			- This shit is currently merciless; why not have a safety net that is a baseline of human needs???
- Context: compensation models for teachers // learning system developers
	- Fetch and attribute learning strategies to all who developed them then distribute funds to them!
	- Time split like as in [[Memorandum of Understanding]]
		- Time spent developing = split of funds.
		- blockchain smart contract for attribution should be able to support this.
- FUNDING IS HARD
	- Initially (as mentioned previously) depend on crowdfunding, freemium model, and the cyclical nature of funds if sticking within ecosystem (cryptocurrency sadly might be the answer in this case)
		- CAVEAT I NEED TO BE CALLED OUT ON::: I am "loving the solution" on my blockchain path; I just feel that it has all of the qualities required to actually make this thing work:
			- Accountability, Attribution, Automation, and Autonomy.
	- Long term: make a public good and fund with taxes once overhead has been properly mitigated. If one can make a backup of everything then its truly free.
		- Charge for services around not the content within
		- This could be done by hitting up the government and just asking to help make a new DOE!
			- DO_2E -> "Decentrallized Organization of Education"
			- AntiDO2E (antidote)
- Context: Cons of losing the university
	- Sports?
		- Have people build their own teams! Privately owned sports teams makes so much more sense than educationally funded IMO. Its a skill, the players are paid; its a fucking business.
			- Yes pay for athletes education if thats what they want; but why force them into academia if they dont want to be there? we dont want anyone here that doesnt want to be here.
		- AKA I believe in the privitization of that sector, but dont think education should be fully privatized (can have plenty of competition by its augmentation if that is free to occur however)
		- 
- Teach kids how to make money from the get go if money is life;;
	- If you have them incubate ideas from their origins when they truly have imagination then they can make such cool shit
	- Even if its nonsensical at least they'll have fun (let them be kids whilst they're kids!!!)
	- Ideally fostering this throughout primary and secondary education could solve the issue of education funding; they build their own funding system for higher education (if a full reform of higher education does not occur)
	- Not a perfect idea; 
		- "assumes all kids have this skillset and it fails those who dont"
		- I would have to disagree to an extent however; I believe that everyone can market themselves; work on their own brand (we all do it without thinking of it!). It is very much a learnable skill, not something entirely nature. 
		- One could argue that a scarcity mindset is required for innovation; to that I propose the following:
			- The only truly relevant scarcity is time.
				- With time there will come innovation; we have become that which decades ago we labeled as sci-fi and I defend the prediction that the same will occur in the next couple of decades to that which we label as sci-fi now.
				- We can overcome the energy crisis
				- We can overcome the material scarcity crisis (even if it means leaving this planet)
				- We can overcome climate change with the solving of that which is above.
				- Everything just takes time.
				- I propose an acceleration of that timeline such that it can happen within our lifetimes.
				- I want to live in the society I write about, therefore I will not sit on my ass and just write about it; rather write it as I create it in this reality.


# [[2025-04-17 (handwritten notes)]]

Time Coin:
- Privacy issue:
	- given X amount (average of lifespan) that ticks down and is converted to currency with impact factor
	- Can only do this by stating what was done for evaluation, but that requires proof, a second and likely third party. 
	- This requires transparency to an extent; esp. if using crypto. Perhaps by using [[crypto as backend]] one can keep things anonymous by just having the platform know who goes to who for auditing but not have it be identifiable who the parties are to the general public (just transparent on what we take from the transaction and how it is split.)

Big-co ideologies:
- "let startups do it"
- "innovation by acquisition"
	AKA they DEPEND on us having cool ideas. That is leverage. THAT is our key to freedom. They have become too slow and are rife with the problem of stagnation. We can outpace them and they know that; so our best key is to resist acquisition by all costs.
Problem Statement: "The current situation is bad because _blank_"
Value Proposition: "We solve this by _blank_"



# [[2025-04-18 (handwritten notes)]]

Couldn't sleep in; woke up hella early. Uploading the raws of this then am crashing for tonight lmao.
Thoughts on foundational structure:
- Charity is a litmus test for the level of altruism in any collective.
- I will try my best to serve this, but if the people don't want it they wont get it!
	- If people don't fund it they don't deserve it, but I'll do it anyways because I think they need it.
	- If not them then the next generation or the next (but sadly I might not be around to see the impact it makes if it doesn't pick up in my lifetime and thats something I struggle with but will get past.)
	- If I build it it will help at least 1 person: me.
- B-Corp / Nonprofit / not for profit / DAO?
	- TLDR Altruistic Capitalism as focus for the platform; can make money on add-ons but I'm sticking to the platform as a public good mentality.

Media Advocacy // [[Outreach]] // [[Subsidiaries and Synergistic partnerships to pursue]]:
- Take Interviews with people I think will be receptive and have a good audience
	- Dua Lipa (her interview hit and if she's into it she does hella research and I respect that hella)
	- Jack Recider - Darknet Diaries (love his content, it's really what got me into tech)
- My Idols:
	- Bill Nye
	- Tom Hanks (at least his characters lmao)
	- Mr. Rodgers
	- Adam Savage
	- Robin Williams (characters and person, watched documentary, so sad but happy)
	- David Foster Wallace (communication as an artform)
	- Basquiat and Andy Warhol (documentary again, very misunderstood people)
	- Michael Reeves (funny, intelligent, entertaining)
	- Jacob Collier
	- Simone Giertz
	- The ancient greeks
		- Plato
		- Socrates
		- Aristotle (?) - idrk, alexander the great was a mishap lmao
		- Oracle of delphi was a crazy concept lmao but mad respect for getting an entire nation to respect a stoner
Note to Publishers, Peer Reviewers, and Academia:
- The times are changing (already have). Publishers in their foundational roles are no longer a necessity. They failed to prevent open access but are in denial (paywalls despite "illicit" resources like libgen, annas archive, sci-hub, thepiratebay to an extent, the internet archive, and the internet itself for that matter) that prove the world's HUNGER for knowledge. Peer reviewers, however, are an absolute necessity to academic integrity therefore should be supported. I propose a separation of the entities mentioned as such; I am of the firm belief that peer reviewers do not do the work to make the research in the first place thus should not have any control over who is able to access it for what price. Contact any academic and they'd kill to give their paper to you, for you to read it and have an actual conversation with them about it. It is their lives you are gatekeeping. We have the tech to revolutionize this industry, just need to use it. LET US HELP YOU.
	- Let us help you compensate academics.
	- Let us help you compensate the peer reviewal process.
	- Let us help you fund the revolutionary research we need to progress as a society.
	- Let us help you garner the attention needed to get the stated funding.
	- Let us help you spread the intellectual wealth to ALL THAT NEED IT (everyone).

Funding the platform:
- Free to students. Forever. (whilst still students I mean)
- TLDR: COGS is servers, development, compensating creators, and compensating for our effect on the environment. No profit should be made over that for the platform (as a public good). Money can be made on accelerative add-ons --time is our only finite resource-- i.e. games, tools, etc.
- Attempted pricing breakdown for charging customer (businesses, institutions, nations etc.)
	- Low cost to the individual
	- Minimal cost (no profit) for K-12, just ask them to help out where possible
	- "High" cost to private universities until they bring their costs down.
	- Medium cost to public universities (idk, might keep same as K-12, people need higher education and I'm falling into the profit mindset)
	- Medium cost to incubators akin to individual structured into groups, allow for group discount?
- Environmental impact will increase costs until we solve the issues present.
- Alternative funding structure: Advertisements // sponsorships (bleh)
	- For those who purely consume (don't create) and don't want to pay can do the freemium model only up until costs have been comped (i.e. incentivize consumption past the point of having ads / allow for one to just watch a ton of ads at the beginning or something idk)
	- Incentivizes creation or funding of the platform and stimulates the economy (the current justification for advertisements, I still hate them though they're too distracting)
	- See [[2025-04-19 (handwritten notes)]] for more ideas on this, only relevant ads go to user.

# [[2025-04-19 (handwritten notes)]]


- Time Based Economy
	- Users: set base time in wallet per sub-platform / category (education, music, entertainment)
	- 1 token = one hour? or can do as minute as seconds even
	- Time is spent with every second, even if idle (feeds back to platform fund if not spent anywhere else)
	- No way to spend more time other than multi-consuming (i.e. separation of funding pools between music and other other forms of content might be required)
		- If not separate funds, split time based on attention factor? or just even split idk.
	- Regardless, creators receive this token and cash out on a cyclical basis
		- Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
			- Incentivize longer cycles to lower volatility of the token value
				- rebates 
				- better rates token value rates
				- expedited processing fees
	- Under the assumption that most creators will consume content as well, they recieve the same baseline as users; same token but excess at end of cycle is what is cash-outable
		- perhaps set minimum account balance for continuing access to consume; if cashed out block access to public good until the next month / cycle.
			- ACTUALLY NO; cannot go below account balance for consumption; otherwise would then have ability to account farm and just leech funds (side hustle to pay people to not access resources lmaooo)
			- But maybe? would incentivize people to gtfo of platform when only used for entertainment; this should be addicting / fun but we want people to live lives off-platform... (unlike most social media these days).
				- Just have to differentiate between use cases; for students cannot go below minimum account balance; for charity cannot go below minimum account balance (for serving underserved); but for individual fuck it why not its their money.
				- ~DAO decision-point~ - cost of token (proportionally the amount creators get) to be controlled by token sinks and faucets
Page 2:
- But how does this time-based token gain  and keep economic value?
	- Funding sources:
		- Taxes (if public and federally funded)
		- Non-student user fees
		- sponsorships (companies pay to be shouted out; aka advertisements but I hate advertisements in their current state so that is a no-no word lmao)
			- Separate sponsorships per focus type because that shits mad distracting and annoying if not relevant (education, music, entertainment, shopping, etc.)
				- Ex: within education focus only allow for relevant educative resources to be shown to the user
				- think of it like the platform is providing a resource rather than shoving a product down the user's throat.
			- Advertisers get their money back if nobody was on topic to receive their product recommendation
				- reduces risk of their investment (thus can incentivize small businesses to run advertisements without fear of it burning their runway inefficiently; currently feels like a gamble unless you have an SEO professional and entire fucking marketing team behind your ads being created)
					- This isn't meant to displace the SEO people and marketing people though; the quality of the ad will be directly proportional to the click-through rate if there is a product-consumer fit to be found; just doesn't waste the valuable resource that is all of our time on hitting a goddamn quota to make a fuckn buck (yes google I'm talking to you).
				- increases effectiveness of ads without needlessly showing the ad to people who dont give a fuck just to hit a quota
					- Our service should perform at least to the ability of google AdSense in that as such because it really does just shove shit down your throat hoping something sticks.
				- allows us to mobilize funds whilst they are waiting on us to find someone interested in their product; be transparent about this!!! 
					- we don't want to get caught with pants down though so they've gotta lock into a set timeframe for the product-consumer fit search to run and pay an expedition fee if they want the cash back asap
Page 3:
- Overhead is not entirely avoidable sadly:
	- Server costs
	- Our employees salaries (if still even doing salaries in this new economic framework... compensation nonetheless)
		- Content taggers and Moderators
		- Course coordinators
		- Mentors
		- Developers for when bugs get rampant (esp if everyone is on this itll be fuckn BUGGY at first)
	- Likely will also need to fund carbon credits to offset use of AI
		- ~DAO decision-point~ - which credits / methods / how much of an offset (ideally 100% offset but if can afford more then fuck it lets use this platform to solve climate change too :) )



# [[Analysis of More by Hangmeas]]
### 🔧 Reframing Affiliate Infrastructure as Educational Infrastructure

#### 🧠 1. **Pick a Niche → Identify Educational Catalysts**

**Affiliate Insight**: Focus succeeds in niches. **ARX Adaptation**:

- Segment curriculum into **problem-based learning domains** (e.g., climate engineering, distributed systems, ethics of tech).
    
- Identify **high-leverage catalysts** (e.g., teaching entropy and systems thinking through real-world projects like orbital thermodynamics or traceable economics).
    

> _Focus the curriculum not on siloed subjects, but on solving existential-scale challenges._

---

#### 🌐 2. **Build a Website → Build an Open Knowledge Platform**

**Affiliate Insight**: Set up a site with clear brand and monetization structure. **ARX Adaptation**:

- Create a **decentralized, publicly editable educational OS**—like a GitHub for world-saving ideas (think: “ARX Academy”).
    
- Integrate tools like:
    
    - AI-driven knowledge curation (a la NotionAI meets Khan Academy).
        
    - Peer-reviewed submissions (open yet trustable).
        
    - Blockchain for **proof-of-contribution and idea lineage**.
        

> _Let this be the forge where planetary-scale education is designed, versioned, and deployed._

---

#### 📈 3. **Drive Traffic → Drive Participation**

**Affiliate Insight**: SEO, social media, newsletters drive income. **ARX Adaptation**:

- **Optimize for curiosity**—gamify global learning via explorer quests, not grades.
    
- Use TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and microcurriculum formats to:
    
    - Teach ethics in 60 seconds.
        
    - Explain planetary heat exchange as a meme.
        
    - Debate economic traceability through interactive media.
        

> _Virality = viability when the content reshapes paradigms._

---

#### 🧲 4. **Affiliate Links → Contribution Credits**

**Affiliate Insight**: Trackable links drive compensation. **ARX Adaptation**:

- Track **educational impact & innovation lineage** with crypto-style contribution tokens.
    
    - e.g., “Landon taught 40k people about entropy harvesting—here’s a transparent ledger of reuse.”
        
- Allow contributors to **mint NFTs of breakthrough ideas**, with credit embedded.
    

> _Knowledge should not be sold, but its influence should be traceable and honorably compensated._

---

#### 🧰 5. **Use Tools & Courses → Open-Source the Toolbox**

**Affiliate Insight**: Success depends on access to quality tools. **ARX Adaptation**:

- Provide a curated, open repository of:
    
    - Modular curricula (MIT OCW, LibreTexts, custom ARX content).
        
    - Tools for prototyping planetary infrastructure (e.g., CAD, thermodynamic models, LLMs for synthesis).
        
- Make tool literacy part of **every student’s onboarding into planetary citizenship**.
    

> _If GitHub is the toolbox of software devs, ARX should be the toolbox of planetary stewards._

---

#### 📊 6. **Track Conversions → Track Meaning**

**Affiliate Insight**: You can’t improve what you don’t measure. **ARX Adaptation**:

- Track:
    
    - Educational engagement (not just completion).
        
    - Innovation flow: How often does an idea lead to a project? How often does a question turn into collaboration?
        
    - Moral growth: e.g., how many learners shift from personal success goals to collective stewardship goals?
        

> _Metrics should quantify humanity’s trajectory—not just clicks._

---

### 🔁 Optional Recursive Loop:

Once the educational system becomes **a living knowledge engine**, it feeds your orbital heat engine vision:

- Students trained in systems thinking → create better thermal conversion arrays.
    
- Open-source designs → get contributed to global orbital ring archives.
    
- Financial traceability from educational contributions → funds their deployment.
    

This feedback loop could form the **“ARX Engine”**—not just a heat engine, but a **humanity engine**.

# [[Memorandum of Understanding]]
## I. PURPOSE

This is not a job. This is not entertainment. This is the coordinated, intentional rise of a better empire — a non-tyrannical revolution grounded in trust, transparency, and mutual support.

We are building a system where **people come before profit** and **only take what they need**. If we succeed, we will have proven that shared action and mutual care can outcompete extractive, individualist systems — using the very tools they gave us.

---

## II. PHILOSOPHICAL ALIGNMENT

To **fully participate**, you must share and uphold our foundational values:

- **Use money and tools for good**, not exploitation.
    
- **Take only what you need** — no hoarding, no greed.
    
- **If you try to exploit or sabotage the effort, you will be respectfully removed.**
    
- **If your goals are aligned, you are welcome. If not, step aside.**
    

You are not required to believe everything I believe — but you must not act in opposition to the vision: equitable access, mutual uplift, and creative autonomy.

---

## III. STRUCTURE OF ENGAGEMENT

- This is a **temporary, collaborative heist** — completely legal, fully transparent, and entirely fueled by trust.
    
- You may leave at any time. Once the work is done, we may part ways freely.
    

---

## IV. TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT

1. **Open Source Commitment**  
    Upon completion and fulfillment of all individual needs (to be defined via group consensus), the tools, services, and assets created will be released under an open license and managed by a **Digital Autonomous Organization (DAO)**.
    
    - No participant holds exclusive IP rights to shared assets.
        
    - You may reuse and build upon your contributions elsewhere, as long as you respect open source principles.
        
2. **Documentation Requirement**
    
    - All contributions must be documented through our **team Zettelkasten** and **video-recorded logs**.
        
    - Time logs will be verified by a neutral third party.
        
    - You may opt out of public visibility by:
        
        - Using a **working pseudonym**
            
        - Requesting **facial scrubbing, voice modulation, metadata removal**, etc.
            
3. **Compensation Model** – _Time-Based Equity of Need_
    
    - Funds raised will be distributed according to verified time contributed.
        
    - **All time is valued equally** unless adjusted by the following modifiers:
        
        - 🧠 _Pre-existing IP Bonus_: +X% (to be negotiated)
            
        - 🕰️ _Overtime Rate_: +50% of split percentage earned per hour for hours beyond 40/wk
            
        - ⏳ _Failure Modifier_: After Day 60, if group goals are unmet, contribution rate decays by X% per hour/day
            
            - Intended to create urgency, not punishment
                
            - Note: If evolving into an ongoing thinktank with housing or makerspace support this would be the gimmick.
                

---

## V. FINAL NOTES

- This agreement is based on **trust and shared intent**, not legal threat.
    
- We are building something new. If we succeed, it will be because we believed we could — and because we **shared it all**.

# [[Compensation methods]]

Akin to DOI, ContentID, SSID, and the basic URL, everything and everyone needs to be given an identifier for traceability of impact attribution and compensation (idea for platform: [[ARX CDN]]). To transition to the [[ crypto as backend]] idea make wallets for each entity (be it a research paper, audio, video, image, NFT, whatever the fuck kind of digital good you want to apply this to) and identify the person(s) in charge of the project to task with distributing the funds (to be decided retroactively by those identified as project leads; will be communicating with the individual workers and unions surrounding the worker though such that exploitation does not continue; make sure they know their rights and leverage). Default to even split if nothing is taken within X amount of time. (Yes if they never pull these funds itll be a waste of time and energy but thats the beauty of crypto, if they dont convert the funds to their native currency the value of the cryptocurrency does not depreciate, although is held up; if they do pull the funds the funds go back to the platform / another user of the platform and there are three economic outcomes for that worker: they spend it on the platform, spend it off the platform, or save it TO SPEND LATER. In this day and age consumption is a safe bet lmao, just a matter of time. Regardless the economy is stimulated, the platform grows, and the mission is achieved.)


## Subsidiaries // Synergistic partnerships to pursue:
Activity pub integration - sync all action across all platforms s.t. one can create and maximize impact to users off platform

Content creation and distribution platforms :: Youtube (google) / insta (meta) / X / patreon idgaf  - creators that utilize youtube (any platform for that matter) can and should be able to opt to share their content on our platform as well; request their integration with activity-pub and if rejected target the creators themselves; the mentality that one cannot do this is just a mental block lmao, we have the ability to contact anyone and everyone on this planet with a few clicks of a button and that is here to stay so fuck it lets use it for good.

Content creators themselves :: I really want to reach out to all of my favorite musicians and designers to ask for help / to use their music / designs in marketing this (from the people for the people as is the true American ideology ~ from the creators for the creators) 

Knowledge platforms :: Khan Academy / udemy / individual education content creators
	Incentivize with novel compensation platform (and don't limit them to our platform!!!)
		Little to no risk unless the platforms try to clap back and cut their monetization but if they do that they are greedy fucks that deserve to lose their community.
	My list is down below

The Government :: The Department of Education // DOGE - I just applied for DOGE this morning but if they are already trying to reform the education system lets save them the time and effort lmao (and save the time and effort that went into creating the DOE in the first place; if just shut down thats such a waste IMO)

Content creation tools
	Give creators an edge!
		Figma
		Adobe

LLM tools:
	OpenAI, ollama (meta), grok (X), claude, perplexity, you name it (too many these days);
	Offer to have them all integrated and the user gets to pick (compensate the AI companies accordingly but like fuck it why not???)
		Train a model to switch between models per task agentic style if need be

Education institutions:
	Yes this may "make them obsolete" but it doesnt have to end their existance altogether at all!?!?
	The business side of things is great; they as institutions are great; I just disagree of the conflation of finances and learning in the way that it currently is.
	Additionally the communities built are priceless; the Socratic method only works when interlocutors interact and collaborate towards the fundamental pursuit of knowledge.
		Sadly the overhead of in-person activities is hard to reduce; the in-person schooling may become a luxery; but thats just a problem we need to try to solve later on down the line. As of now if we can reduce the clutter of course managment and certification I think that will make an immense dent in the cost of in-person education anyways; so fuck it we ball.
	Offer our tool as a backend to them to use to help their students prosper; as a tool to connect students with their ideal pursuits.

Personal favorites:
Are.na - board view integration;; art content etc
Github - request hosting assistance whilst we get things set up; 
Uploadthing // Theo - t3.gg - love his content and think he'd be down to help out with hosting if github falls through
Leanstack - creation pipeline that can be integrated
Obsidian - personal knowledge managment system (free!) with amazing community; def think they'd be down for it to be integrated if it isn't charged for.
	If not can just prompt users to go get it themselves and just use it...
	Direct the user to define a folder to call home to their second brain and build our own stuff.
	Local-hosting personal information is an imperative to true security (ofc backup and sync but can use github / offer our own backups if they want to share their data with us; its an issue of trust).
