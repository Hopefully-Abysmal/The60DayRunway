Pulling information from : [[DAO Voting Structures]] [[DAO Voting Models Exploration]] [[Funding Cycle for Open Access Education With Accelerative Learning Tools.canvas|Funding Cycle for Open Access Education With Accelerative Learning Tools]] and misc handwritten notes: [[2025-04-29 (handwritten notes)]]

LLM Conversating tracked in: [[DAO Governance Chat]]

### **MetaGov Meeting Cheat Sheet: Stakeholder Talking Points**

|**Stakeholder**|**What to Highlight**|**Potential Concerns**|**Reimagined Angle / What to Lean Into**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Governance Researchers**|Reflective, knowledge-informed voting; fractional delegation; voting lifecycle orchestration|Mathematical edge cases, delegation labyrinths, voter fatigue|Tackle the democratic crucible directly; invite simulations and philosophical delving|
|**DAO Technologists / Devs**|Delegation cap, visibility thresholds, vote tracking; time-bound delegation|UX complexity, scaling smart contracts|Intricate, modular architecture that beckons interoperability and fine-tuned control|
|**Education Innovators**|PKM-as-digital-twin, impact tokens, content traceability|Overhead, evaluation consistency|Transcend test-centric models; reward long-term memory, curiosity, and mosaic cognition|
|**Philosophers / Social Theorists**|Decentralized epistemology, neurodivergent inclusion, aura of impact|Elitism concerns, consensus paradoxes|A verdant frontier of thought—reclaim slowness, nuance, and reflective autonomy|
|**Funders / Builders**|Time & impact-based compensation; anti-slop incentive structures|Abuse vectors, token volatility|Frame as a kaleidoscopic, anti-extractive ecosystem; victuals for the curious soul, not the algorithm|
|**General MetaGov Audience**|Holistic governance ecosystem, not just better voting|Overwhelm at ambition|It's an enigmatic tapestry—invite them to embark, not absorb all at once; let curiosity be their compass|

End with:

> “We're building a crucible where education and governance don’t just coexist—they orchestrate a kaleidoscopic future of knowledge stewardship.”


Fillable framework for chat:

Here’s a **fillable table** (copy-paste ready for Notion, Obsidian, Google Docs, or printout) you can use during your meeting to jot down MetaGov’s responses, critiques, suggestions, or potential collaborators per topic.
