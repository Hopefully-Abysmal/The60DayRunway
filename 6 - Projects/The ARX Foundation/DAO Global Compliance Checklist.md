## **1. DAO Structuring**

- [ ] Choose governance tooling (e.g., Aragon, Tally, Snapshot)
- [ ]  Separate DAO governance from any U.S. citizen/LLC for critical control
-  Use a **jurisdictionless frontend** (IPFS, ENS, decentralized access)
-  Assign a multi-sig wallet or Gnosis Safe with global signers (diversified jurisdictions)
-  Decide on token issuance policy (utility, governance, soulbound, etc.)

---

## **2. Legal Entity Wrappers**

-  Register **nonprofit or foundation** (Cayman, Switzerland, Bermuda, Panama, etc.)
    
-  Ensure the wrapper is **not U.S.-based** if avoiding U.S. securities implications
    
-  Match foundation purpose to DAO charter (education, open tech, etc.)
    
-  Create separate **Operating Agreements or Bylaws** that respect DAO vote outcomes
    
-  Set up **contractual relationships** (DAO <> Foundation <> other entities)
    

---

## **3. IP and Revenue Channeling**

-  Assign IP (platform, brand, AI models) to **Irish Entity**
    
-  Establish **intercompany licensing agreements** (arm’s length pricing)
    
-  Use **Dutch entity** for EU compliance and royalty routing
    
-  Contract with **Hopefully Abysmal LLC** for creative work via U.S. 1099 or services agreement
    
-  Include **reasonable royalty or platform fees** to IPCo (not zeroed out)
    

---

## **4. Tax Compliance**

-  File **economic substance documentation** for Ireland/Dutch entities
    
-  Document and apply **transfer pricing rules** for royalties, fees, or asset use
    
-  Monitor **U.S. Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC)** exposure (GILTI tax rules)
    
-  If U.S. person owns >50% of foreign corp, consult tax attorney for pass-through effects
    
-  Keep **separate books and reporting** for each legal entity
    

---

## **5. Token & Treasury Management**

-  Determine token classification (utility, governance, donation, etc.)
    
-  Avoid U.S. exchange listing or marketing if token has financial value
    
-  Use **non-U.S. foundation** or DAO to issue and manage token smart contracts
    
-  Track token distributions for **KYC-lite** compliance (if needed)
    
-  Implement **on-chain governance processes** with transparent logs
    

---

## **6. Employment, Grants & Contractors**

-  Use **Deel, Remote, or similar** to hire globally
    
-  Issue **DAO grants via smart contracts** (document as bounties, not wages)
    
-  For U.S.-based work: W-2 or 1099 with contracts from U.S. LLC, **not DAO directly**
    
-  Add indemnification clauses in contributor terms (protect DAO from liability)
    

---

## **7. Public Communication & Regulatory Safety**

-  Use **neutral, educational language** for public-facing messaging
    
-  Clearly state that DAO does not offer financial returns or speculative assets
    
-  Maintain a **transparency page** listing DAO votes, treasury flows, and proposals
    
-  Consider **DAO Legal Shield services** (LexDAO, KaliDAO, Orca) for extra protection
    
-  Keep jurisdictional disclaimers on all platforms (“Not intended for XYZ residents…”)
    

---

## **8. Optional — Contingency & Risk**

-  Include DAO fallback mechanisms (in case of emergency vote or treasury lock)
    
-  Create a **DAO risk assessment document** (custody, token, legal, regulatory)
    
-  Set up a **small multisig legal budget** for handling surprise challenges
    
-  Use a DAO vault or revenue buffer to store 6–12 months of op funds
