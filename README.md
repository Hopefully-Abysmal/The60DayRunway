## What Is This?

**The 60 Day Runway** is a public 2-month challenge to escape student debt, secure housing, and build a sustainable, creator-owned life — all before June 30, 2025. It's a test of self-rescue, autonomy, and creative momentum.

This isn’t just a hustle. It’s the **origin story of The Arx Foundation** — a long-term effort to build tools, ideas, and support structures for people stuck in survival loops. The goal is to challenge the myth of merit, reveal the hidden architecture of economic traps, and share everything I learn in the open.

## The Mission

Revolutionize // reform the education system as we know it. We are in a time of misinformation, fear, and turmoil; now is better than any other time to make a change so thats what we are doing.

Specifically: "Make Academia Great Again" by processing and centralizing knowledge on a publically owned platorm ([DO2E // SCOOL // The Creostic Academia](https://github.com/Hopefully-Abysmal/The60DayRunway/blob/main/6%20-%20Projects/Outreach/Building%20a%20Better%20Future%20Through%20Business%20and%20AI%20Application.md)) with the aim of decentralizing the tools to access and utilize knowledge in general. The end goal is to create a marketplace of intellectual acceleration methods and strategies; we believe that people can think for themselves and want to ensure that is a secure statement.

## Why?

Generational Motivations:
	Because we have been trained to think we can't.
	- Can't own
	- Can't escape
	- Can't think for ourselves
	- Can't make the world a better place???

General Team Motivations:
	Because we can.

Landon's Motivations:
	Because I graduated with honors and still can't afford rent.  
	Because my wife deserves a degree without our lives collapsing.  
	Because I want to build something that helps others do the same.

** insert your motivations if you help out! **

We believe in making it visible — in **livestreaming** the climb, the mistakes, the breakthroughs, and the burnout; the current market lacks transparency. Open source doesn't mean just community driven; it means complete transparency in all aspects; complete accountability for the power the entity gains.

## Knowledge Corpus Built With

- 🧠 **Obsidian** + Zettelkasten (knowledge work)
- 🛠️ **Python**, **Markdown**, JSON Canvases, and Mermaid
- 💡 Livestreams, blogs, devlogs, and mini-lessons
- 🎥 Community-supported via [HopefullyAbysmal](patreon.com/HopefullyAbysmal)

## Immediate Needs

- **Funding support** for editors, moderators, and infrastructure
- **All video revenue** is being shared among collaborators based on time/impact
- Looking for grants, community backers, or people who want to co-build something different
- Attention. Share this with your friends, family, colleagues, anyone who will listen; we are a democratic society and the only way change occurs is with volume of opinion.

## Long-Term Vision: The Arx Foundation

> "What if the systems we need already exist — they just haven't been connected yet for some reason?"

**The Augment Realities Experience (Arx) Foundation** is the name I’m giving to this larger dream — a network of open tools, ideas, stories, and support systems to help people survive long enough to create. It starts with me, but it won’t end with me.
