# The 60 Day Runway ✈️  
_The Beginnings of The Arx Foundation_

## What Is This?

**The 60 Day Runway** is a public 2-month challenge to escape student debt, secure housing, and build a sustainable, creator-owned life — all before June 30, 2025. It's a test of self-rescue, autonomy, and creative momentum.

This isn’t just a hustle. It’s the **origin story of The Arx Foundation** — a long-term effort to build tools, ideas, and support structures for people stuck in survival loops. The goal is to challenge the myth of merit, reveal the hidden architecture of economic traps, and share everything I learn in the open.

## Why?

Generational Motivations:
	Because we have been trained to think we can't.
	- Can't own
	- Can't escape
	- Can't think for ourselves
	- Can't make the world a better place???

General Team Motivations:
	Because we can.

Landon's Motivations:
	Because I graduated with honors and still can't afford rent.  
	Because my wife deserves a degree without our lives collapsing.  
	Because I want to build something that helps others do the same.

** insert your motivations if you help out! **

We believe in making it visible — in **livestreaming** the climb, the mistakes, the breakthroughs, and the burnout; the current market lacks transparency. Open source doesn't mean just community driven; it means complete transparency in all aspects; complete accountability for the power the entity gains.

## Long-Term Vision: The Arx Foundation

> "What if the systems we need already exist — they just haven't been connected yet for some reason?"

**The Augment Realities Experience (Arx) Foundation** is the name I’m giving to this larger dream — a network of open tools, ideas, stories, and support systems to help people survive long enough to create. It starts with me, but it won’t end with me.
